2020-09-10,False,4,You kind of know when you buy something like Swarovski you are going to get a beautiful piece of jewelry.  This piece definitely stood up to it’s brand name.  The rhodium plated metal hoops are both beautiful and well made.  There are no marks on the metal that I could find and the each one of the little crystals prongs are securely holding it in.  The hoops have an easy post type closure which makes putting them on easier than some hoops.  All the crystals are extremely vibrant and you can really see the fire and sparkle as soon as any light hits it.  The only thing I would say about these earrings is they look much bigger in the pictures.  If you have larger earlobes or if your piercing hole is really high from the bottom of your lobe your ear will probably be pressed up against the bottom of the hoop.  Overall I would say these are exactly what you would expect from the Swarovski brand and can highly recommend them but please make sure they will fit your ears.,955,126,Jewelry,4.6,,1,0.0004
2020-09-05,False,4,"These earring are beautiful . The Swarovski Circle earrings sparkle and shine. The white crystals are embedded beautifully into the silver colored background. The settings are great quality, but they don’t hide any of the sparkle or shimmer of every embedded crystal. They are a little smaller than I expected. The entire earring, smaller than the size of a nickel.Despite that, they still made an absolutely beautiful addition to the girlfriends jewelry collection. She is not a fan of large or overly flashy jewelry. So this set was ideal for her. They absolutely look like high end, designer jewelry but a fraction of the cost. She’s with them for a few occasions now, and they are holding up extremely well, no signs of wear or tear. Certainly looking forward to watching her wear these for many years to come. And possibly consider getting her the matching bracelet and necklace pendant as well.",955,126,Jewelry,4.6,,1,0.0001
2022-01-30,True,3,"Comme pour une autre paire commandée ces jours ci, qui venait de swarovski de hong kong (...) , jai un doute sur l'authenticité de cette paire. Je n'ai pas recu de carte d'autjenticité comme dans l'autre, tamponnée du magasin de provenance. Les boucles netaient pas maintenues avec un plastique comme l'autre paire, et l'écrin semblait avoir déja été ouvert.En comparant les deux boites, la police de l'écriture swarovski sur le coté n'est pas la même et pas ecrite au même niveau. La texture de la boit3 est différente également.Je ne saurais dire si je me suis faite entuber, mais je vous conseille de vous méfier tout de meme. Moins cher que sur le site officiel oui, mais sans carte d'authenticité je ne pourrais même pas l'amener en boutique les faire réparer etc.Néanmoins, au dela de ca, cette paire est magnifique, et malgré mes doutes je les portent avec plaisir elles font leur petit effet",358,50,Jewelry,4.6,,12,0.001
2022-01-30,True,3,"Servizio Amazon impeccabile, spedizione velocissima e arrivata al punto di ritiro con due giorni di anticipo. La collana è fine ed elegante e il punto luce è bellissimo. Arriva nella scatoletta Swarovski, perfetta per un regalo. Purtroppo il problema che ho riscontrato è l'assenza del certificato di garanzia. Ho parlato in un primo momento con un operatore di Amazon via chat, il quale è stato molto poco professionale e avevo l'impressione che mi prendesse per i fondelli. Mi ha fatto comunque stampare la garanzia Amazon che dovrebbe valere anche come certificato di autenticità, nonostante non abbia risposto alla mia domanda (è possibile riceverlo o fare delle verifiche?). Ho provato quindi via mail, venendo poi contattata telefonicamente da un operatore molto cortese che mi ha spiegato che erano stati fatti tutti i controlli del caso e che era originale, ma che era impossibile rintracciare il talloncino, dandomi ragione sulle mie osservazioni. Ritengo che questa cosa sia da rivedere assolutamente perché non va bene, considerando che si parla di marche rinomate.",358,50,Jewelry,4.6,,1,0.3676
2022-10-22,True,2,"I bought this for my 8 year old niece because she loves unicorns. I chose silver because in the pictures,  it was a very nice contrast to the pink and blue stones (the rose gold made the pink stones disappear). However, when i received it, I could hardly even see the stones at all! The unicorn and the monogram initial is hard to discern. The whole thing is barely the size of a nickel! I know its not the most expensive piece of jewelry, but I don't think little kids need ""good"" jewelry and I thought this would be cute for playing dress-up, etc. I haven't decided if I'm going to return it yet, but I would warn anyone that it may look cute in the pictures, but in reality it is much smaller.",65,27,Jewelry,4.6,,11,0.0015
2023-07-05,True,5,"I have been searching high and low for “the” necklace. Meaning the one that just jumped out at me. A girl I follow on TikTok had this one so I decided to order it. I’m so glad I did because I’m in love! I have ordered so many from different jewelry shops that I’ve seen ads for on Instagram etc and none have worked. Either the gold looked so yellow and fake or the quality was just not there. Go figure the $15 necklace from Amazon is the best one I’ve found yet. I’m tempted to order more just to have on hand if this one starts to tarnish (which it hasn’t by the way and I have not taken it off yet. I’ve showered and slept with it and it still looks perfect). Also I will say that the smaller chain that comes with it is more like a choker on me so I can’t wear it. If you have a smaller neck though, it may work for you.",10418,976,Jewelry,4.5,,5,0.0004
2022-11-12,True,4,"I bought this necklace two times. The first time I bought it, it lasted several months without rusting and this is with daily wear - sometimes in shower, to sleep, or with perfume. I didn't mind buying it a second time after it started to rust because I loved it so much.The second time I bought it, I was more careful now that I knew it would rust. I would religiously only wear it when I needed to and was careful to avoid contact with water and perfume. However, It rusted even quicker than the second one! The rust smell on my neck and fingers also became unbearable.I haven't been wearing it for days because of the rust. I'm sad about it because other than that, I truly love the design and look and have gotten many compliments for it.",1693,111,Jewelry,4.5,,15,0.0005
2023-05-05,False,2,While the bracelet does have a nice clasp and it arrived on time (actually sooner than expected) I was very disappointed in the looks of it.  It is pictured as a multi-colored - (and brightly colored) bracelet.  I was sure my granddaughter would love it -  but it was nothing like the picture.  It was basically white or opaque and unless you held it up to bright light there was no color to it at all. ANd even in bright light it has very little color.  Thankfully it didn't cost much but for the $5 spent I could buy prettier at walmart.  While they say you get what you pay for.....  I had hoped I was getting what was advertised in the picture.I would not recommend this item.,26,8,Jewelry,3.7,,0,0.0001
2022-02-01,True,1,"Every single ring that I DID receive came broken. Either they were bent like someone hammered them or the clasp was completely broken off. I also only received 6 of the rings and was missing 2 of them which also happened to be the 2 I was the most excited about of course. The package had several layers yet every single layer was dirty and ripped up. The rings looked dirty like someone literally put them on the ground and just stomped them into the dirt. I asked for a replacement since I did really like the look of the rings as advertised and the replacements, while not broken and dirty like the first set, were poor quality. The clasps barely close and it’s hard to position the bars just right to get them there or they just feel loose. Like the screws are coming undone and will fall apart quickly. I don’t want to bother going through the return process a second time so I guess that’s my loss. Don’t buy this cheap garbage though honestly.",141,44,Jewelry,4.2,,1,0.0001
2021-05-25,True,1,I gave this one star because it advertises that the ring is hypoallergenic and safe one skin. But upon wearing the ring for less than seven days it is already tarnished where it contacts my skin and that tarnish meant has caused a breakout and irritation right under my nose where the piercing drops to. It’s obvious that the only part of the piercing ring that is stainless steel is the piece that actually goes inside of the piercing the rest of it is made out of something else that is going to break your skin out the moment It starts to tarnish. If you have supersensitive skin that you can’t wear fake jewelry I would not suggest you buy this at all. Unless you want to code it with clear nail polish before wearing.,141,44,Jewelry,4.2,,18,0.0003

The clickers are really weak and pop open easily, and one of the piercings can't even stay closed. I've only had one of them in for a day now, so I'll update my review depending on how it oxidizes or if it turns green. Really think my only issue so far is the weak clickers.UPDATE: I've had them for over a month now and I'm disappointed. The one I wore stopped clicking altogether despite not being messed with.

I have never had this happen with any of my body jewelry and it's not like I buy the higher-priced jewelry to begin with.For what I paid, it's not worth being upset over. It's a bummer bc they were cute. If you still decided to buy this, I recommend them for special occasions, definitely not for daily use if you want them to last a while.",90,26,Jewelry,4.2,,0,0.0005
2021-10-17,True,2,"First off the item quality is perfectly fine.The issue I have with this and many other sellers is that it states this jewelry is a multi purpose for your daith, and septum. This jewelry is three SIZES LARGER then the daith jewelry I had in my ear before. It doesn't fit in my ear as a whole let alone in the piercing itself.There should be rules that these sellers aren't allowed to sell something that isn't true. This is SEPTUM jewelry and nothing else. I would love it if i HAD a Septum.All of these pieces are the same size so they can't even pretend they have say one piece per type of piercing as an example some sellers will say 1-daith, 1-helix, 1-nose. This seller states its for ALL types but all the jewelry is the same size and type septum Clickers.SO anyone with a septum will love these but don't be fooled like I was if you need them for any other types of piercings.",90,26,Jewelry,4.2,,3,0.0001
2023-06-27,True,4,"All of them were super cute. I got them for my daith and to replace my nose hoop. Husband helped put the daith in and it was hard to click. 8mm are smallest and had to use tweezers to click closed. Couldn't get fingers in to click it closed. The nose ring took forever to click closed. No matter how hard I pushed it, it wouldn't click closed. I noticed some of them took hardly any force to click closed and some took much more force. You get what you pay for, pretty much. I like that you can hear it click so you know it closed. I'm happy with the purchase. They look super cute in and feel comfortable. They don't hurt and I have super sensitive skin normally so Im glad these aren't doing anything to my piercings so far. Had them in for 3 days in now and still nothing bad. Put one in my mom's nose piercing too and she has even more sensitive skin and she's doing really good with it. She absolutely loves hers and says she had gotten a ton of compliments in just the first day of wearing it.*UPDATE: they are pretty comfortable to wear for long periods of time. Leave my daith in all the time and no irritation or green on my skin. Same with my nose hoop;no irritation or green on my skin (I wear these in the shower a lot). Only thing I have an issue with are the clasps. They are hard to click closed, and my one hoop has a clasp that is easy opened, so it falls out of my nose a lot, especially when i blow my nose.

And just because a girl plays sports and wears boys clothes doesn't mean she should think she is a boy. Nothing like confusing these kids to think they are not normal and making them feel as though they need to transform their bodies because of their likes. I am a woman and grew up playing sports and finding boy clothes most comfortable. I was called a tomboy. If my hormones were altered as a child because adults thought I was confused and they in turn confused me, I would not have my children I have now. Stop the insanity.

2023-07-19,True,5,As a retired educator I learned that a fellow educator had been fired for reading this book to her students.  I like to check out banned books for myself. Nothing in this book is pornography or sexual. It is about young kids growing up knowing they do not fit in the mold society expects them to grow in to. Many of my former students would have appreciated this book when they were young.To ignore these students a failure in the education system. To fire a master teacher for attempting to teach acceptance and civility is quite Orwellian and very scary.…..I digress…. The book is great.

2021-05-20,True,3,"I was really looking forward to this book.I was, however, pretty disappointed. I thought it was going to be a lovely story that was gender inclusive and explanatory. But I honestly felt like I was reading my child descriptions of gender from a dictionary. It was just dry and not at all engaging. I love what the book is trying to do, and I love that books like this exist. This one missed the mark for us though as something that felt engaging or fun. It's like they tried, but didn't quite make it.I do have to note, the artwork is absolutely stunning.I've started a return on the book, for us, it's just not worth keeping. I'm going to keep looking for other books that celebrate gender in all it's fluidity, but also tell stories.If you're looking for a book that is basically dictionary definitions of gender, with gorgeous artwork, then this will work for you. As it does explain quite clearly some of the many forms of gender expression. As well as acknowledging that many people find their own, unique gender expressions as well.However, if you're looking for any kind of storytelling, this just isn't it.",88,67,Children Books,4.7,4.3,4,0.0001

There was no story to convey-- it felt like an informational pamphlet. A missed opportunity given the versatile medium of an illustrated children's book.I hesitate to leave only three stars because I really want to support works like this, but on the merits of the text, it could be a lot better.

2023-03-25,False,1,"I'm paraphrasing here. ""When you were born the people in the room assigned your sex based on how you look. But they could be wrong."" We have all heard the expression ""Assigned male (or female) at birth.""How would that work? The androgenous baby pops out and the doctor looks at them and says ""I can imagine you in a suit and tie and briefcase going to work more than I can imagine you in the kitchen wearing a dress and apron, so you are a boy. He writes ""boy"" in the birth certificate and the baby is whisked off to surgery where male reproductive organs are added.That may sound ludicrous, but by any definition of the word ""assign"", that is what would happen. If a boy or girl pops out and the doctor observes the external reproductive organs and documents the sex as boy or girl, well that wouldn't be ""assigning"", would it? It would be observing and documenting.But the whole ""assign"" myth is nevertheless propagated throughout the ""gender identity"" culture. It is the basis for teaching kids they may not really be the sex ""assigned"" at birth. That could have been an error. It happens all the time. All that is left to do is affirm the sex you actually are.

Instead of ""affirming"" a child that they were indeed born in the wrong body, how about encourage that child to love themselves for who they are. Telling young children there are ""no genders"" but also an ""unlimited amount of genders"" is absurd. Then to know the horrors that await a child if they do decide to go down the road of transition.

How about, that it's ok if you want to become gay, that is normal.  The authors only care about their agenda, when in fact if they cared about children, they'd make a book about finding self love, helping children to communicate how they feel, or helping children to find their unique identity which is about self expression instead of making ones identity about their possible misassigned gender.

2022-04-05,False,4,"This book is excellent for young children and adults alike! The book provides a medium for children and adults to explore gender identity and introduces vital language to discuss the topic. While the book has no central conflict, it reinforces the message that it's ok to be yourself no matter who you are or what you identify with. The book has many different characters who all identify their gender differently, giving children examples of how other people express their gender. Not only is there a wide variety of how individuals may express their gender, but there are other differences that are showcased as well. A child in a wheelchair represents a way of being differently-abled. Many family structures are also shown, including a same-sex couple. There are interracial couples and families as well as people with many different skin tones. While the book does showcase many differences, it is important to note that the child in the wheelchair is a person of color.This book has vibrant colors and engaging visuals. It also makes the language of gender identity accessible to all readers. I also loved that the author included a space for more resources parents/teachers can use in the back of the book, a note on pronouns, and helpful terms to know. The main critique of this book is that it feels more like an informational text than a storybook. This makes it slightly less engaging for children. The book could also expand its representations of disability, as the only disabled person is BIPOC.I would recommend this book to those looking to start the process of understanding different gender identities. This could be a great way to introduce complex vocabulary to children and their caregivers. In addition, it provides a great platform to start asking questions about the assumptions about gender that people hold in their daily lives.",61,7,Children Books,4.7,4.3,0,0.122

He hasn't expressed that he feels transsexual or non-binary, but the ideas of acceptance and understanding yourself really resonated with him. He attends therapy regularly (not related to sexuality), and wanted to bring the book to talk to his therapist about it even. I strongly recommend all children (and adults) read this.

Teachers who might be hesitant to discuss this topic in elementary schools will find this easy to use. Books about crayons and the like will make more sense to kids after reading this.

2021-12-16,False,2,"I’m reviewing this book because I wanted to know what kind of books are now being used by schools to indoctrinate young children. This book teaches that we don’t know what gender a child is at birth but that later on, the child will describe which one they feel or that they may not feel like either. While the pictures feel colorful and fun and inviting, the words are disturbing. A problem has been invented by today’s activist, progressive parents and educators for reasons that we are still exploring. It’s not enough for some people to be boy or girl, man or woman. Life is so unfulfilling and oppressive that we are telling the starfish to scoot over—we’ve decided we’re just as unpredictable. Is it that someone told them that they couldn’t arrange flowers and still be a man? Were they bullied for not being good at sports? Did they not have a father growing up? Were they messed with as a child, molested or abused?Although girls occasionally join in the vehicle sounds and boys show tenderness towards babies, they  are observed to be drawn, almost as if by gravity itself, into interests that the activists consider “sexist.” My daughter spent a lot of time having tea parties and my son preferred superhero masculine toys and all manner of construction vehicles. When they walked up and down toy aisles, they naturally classified girl and boy toys without any commentary from me ever.  But these are healthily attached children from healthy environments. I don’t think these children ever need train tracks to keep them on course; they follow their own course directed by their own physiology. When they were babies in the womb, their bodies were flooded with particular hormones to cause them to be male or female, and it is this biological directive that continues to govern which hormones are dosed in puberty and where normal sexual attraction lies. These things happen without our help when children are allowed to come into sexual maturation without grooming, abuse, and trauma.Despite the almost ruthless enforcement of specific social views today, I can’t buy into it at all based on what we know about biological and hormonal differences between the biological sexes. The sexes are simply not interchangeable…it’s not a matter of feelings or wishes. The rate of depression, anxiety, and suicide in transgenders is only one red flag that we are breaking individuals, sometimes almost permanently rather arriving at a true identity.To bring this forced ideology, this almost state religion into schools is what I equate with sexual grooming and abuse. Although CSE and SEL believe they are liberating children, a four year old doesn’t need to think about sexual arousal. A sixth grader doesn’t need to be asked how many sexual partners they have had. We don’t need insidious children’s books with nice pictures  grooming children toward an aberrant sexuality that normally has roots in childhood trauma and abuse, per some experts in counseling transgenders and homosexuals. The fact that four out of ten students now question their gender shows the success of CSE and SEL programs to indoctrinate and mold young brains. Parents are only just now waking up to these programs and for some, it’s too late for their teens, who have been adopted by a community of activists online and are living a brainwashed life of anti-depressants and victimhood.Why in truth is there a political agenda  that is messing with the minds and hearts of all children? I’m still walking upstream to figure out where the poison is coming from. We have progressive pushers in our school districts who are handing down new lessons for teachers to implement, and anyone who is unsure of it is demeaned, threatened, fired, or cancelled because this isn’t about science anymore. It’s about social justice which is a new moral virtue. There are now inquisitions for professionals, professors, and public figures who question the narrative. Universities will hear nothing to the contrary. Everyone is expected to denounce dissenters. Where is the inclusivity and open-mindedness when we are acting in our fight or flight reptilian brains instead of our midbrain curiosity and exploration? There is no understanding, only adrenaline, mob rioting, pitch forks, and witch trials.This book is the wrong direction. Dead end. Turn around.",11,7,Children Books,4.7,4.3,12,0.00030000000000000003
2021-06-29,False,2,"Before my child read this book, I would have given this 5 stars - a nice, thoughtful book about identity, acceptance, and love for yourself.  However, I no longer think that.  The problem is that it treats ""gender identity"" as an abstract feeling, untethered to biology or culture, with no acknowledgement of diversity of gender expression.  My daughter read it at preschool and in kindergarten with her teachers and classmates.  Prior to reading it, she never expressed any confusion about her identity - she was a girl who liked what she liked and that included superheroes and her doll.  She had naturally short hair and was sometimes mistaken for a boy but would correct it and was comfortable.  She did not know what the words ""male,"" ""female,"" ""binary"" or ""identity"" meant.  But she was just starting to reach the age where kids sort each other by sex and start making limits ""no girls allowed,"" or ""you have to be the mom cause you're a girl.""  For her, the book seems to have created distress and confusion - something that requires her to have to CHOOSE a gender identity, rather than just being herself.  There's no acknowledgement in the book of the biological reality that, absent extensive medical intervention, kids will grow up to have one kind of body or another and that those are basically binary choices.  Or that gender identity is complex - it's more than feelings, it's also socialization, culture, expression, how safe you feel in expressing aspects of yourself, etc.  We've spent the past 7 months nurturing our daughter as she works through these questions (she identifies now as having a ""girl body"" and being herself), but I think that the book created a bit of a crisis that wouldn't have happened organically.",11,7,Children Books,4.7,4.3,14,0.0011

Like the idea that doctors arbitrarily assign gender at birth, when in fact the vast majority of people feel the gender they are born with represents them. Truthfulness does not invalidate personal experience, and being trans is rare. Also, no medical procedure can actually change your gender. You can present as something that feels comfortable, and of course this is acceptable. I think the majority of parents would find the concepts in this book much too advanced. Most kids will simply want to know WHY someone doesn't think they are the gender with which they were born, and the answer is NOT ""Oh, well you see the doctor was just guessing, you dont know until later"". Doctors do not guess. Even if its not visually evident a DNA test will firmly tell you your gender at birth.  Some people may feel the birth gender doesnt best represent them, and we dont know why. Thus I find the book very inaccurate. But of course, every parent has their own priorities, and may feel inclusion is more important then accuracy, and that is certainly up to them.

They do their best to accent the absolute lack of anything that is happening in the prose.No. Just no. The premise of the idea: that every color is suitable for every person, is wonderful! Yes! This is exactly what we want to be teaching from the earliest age possible. Colors are, in fact, genderless. However (and I mean however in the strongest possible form of BUT), one actually has to carry through on a plan.The book merely recites over and over that color X (or y or z) is suitable for one gender and the other (assuming of course that there are only two genders). It gives limited, brief, examples (in the illustrations) of how boys and girls can “wear” the color in different (and the same) situations.Repeating the statement over and over, however, does little to reach a child. It’s certainly not the way to undo years of societal programming. For starters, the book does nothing to address why colors are genderless other than repeat the mantra over and over again. And, it provides no added value for the lesson it is trying to teach.Now, maybe I’m asking too much of a children’s book. But, the book is not free.

Ultimately, QT seeks to alienate kids from their parents and families by getting kids to view them as complicit in a ""hetero-normative patriarchal system of oppression.""

Nonetheless it inserts medical anatomical terminology in an attempt to appeal to the twelve year old reader.  It is not engaging the way it is done. The book needs a good editor to become neutral and objective. Sadly it labels people as belonging to two groups as “other people” and LGBTQIA people.  Labeling  humanity into two groups historically leads to conflict.  The author’s labeling of humans into two groups can logically not help to be non-inclusive.

There are a few cartoon drawings inside, so I recommend readers take a look before sharing with children. Some parts are clearly repetitive and could use some editing in those areas.

2020-07-03,False,4,"4.5 Stars (received on Net Galley)This is a very well-done book: it seeks to use inclusive language and educate kids about a variety of different topics in informative but non-judgmental ways. Some kids (and adults) might be made to feel uncomfortable with the diagrams but as there is so much misinformation about body parts that I think this is probably a good thing to have even if makes people uncomfortable (calling body parts by their actual names can have abuse made apparent more easily). I was someone who didn't take grade 9 gym so I missed sex-ed and while I got the gist of most things it would have been nice to have a quick thing to read to make sure I was on the right page about things.Each topic in here is brief but I think does a decent job of covering the main things that everyone should know about their bodies. I just have a few minor things that I would add/on emphasize in a reprint:- More emphasis on intersex bodies: intersex bodies are covered but I would have liked to have seen more of it when talking about pregnancy, intimacy, and more intersex-specific diagrams. I know that there is a wide variety when it comes to being intersex but I feel that in each chapter there should be a bit about how this is typically the same/different for people who are intersex.- Have consent be brought up earlier. I think when sex is first mentioned as being between two grown-ups there should be a reference to how an adult and a kid isn't okay. It is implied and it is mentioned later but I would have liked to have seen it mentioned here too.- Discussion about weight. Kids get fat-shamed from a really young age and weight fluctuation can be a result of hormones so a chapter or even a paragraph on how weight relates to the other topics I think would be beneficial especially when talking about bodily consent.This was a really well done book-- diagrams had a fair amount of variety and the topics were brief but covered clearly. I would consider this sort of like a junior version of Dr. Gunter's ""The Vagina Bible.""While I'm sure this book would result in a fair number of awkward conversations and blushes, the information is solid and critically important for kids to know.",44,3,Children Books,4.8,4.6,21,0.0

Honestly, I might hand it to the older members of my family as well just for those sections. Partly serious.

2020-10-19,True,5,"I was very impressed with this book. While it's advertised as being appropriate for ages 8-12 the language might be a little advanced in some areas for some children particularly around anatomy. I would definitely recommend that parents/trusted adults read this with the child and be prepared to discuss the material. Use the book as a tool to enhance conversation you are already having with your children. I love the inclusive language throughout the book and how it covers the multitude of variations in relationship with equality. Unfortunately most books of this nature that I have run across include more or less of the authors own moral opinion and while this one is by far the most inclusive and open minded I have ever seen there were a few spots that felt a little too much like they were imposing their own rules particularly when discussing masturbation and when and where it was appropriate. Again, it's just one more way that the book is great for opening dialog with your child if used as a tool and not as the end of the discussion. The only real fault I could find is that I would have loved to have seen more illustrations.

The dress is a bit big up top for me as my bra size has decreased from a full 42F to a deflated 38DD so I could've gone down a size in measurements but it fit great everywhere else. The corset back helps with the roominess up top and no one can tell its too big for me lol. Also when tracking delivery—-dont freak out when you see the package sitting at one location for a whole week. It will be delivered on time.,119,47,Kidswear,4.5,,1,0.0001
2022-10-15,True,5,I was so unsure about ordering A dress like this off Amazon but my daughter fell in love with the style of this dress. I took advantage of the ability to have it made in her size. The company messaged me requesting info and sizes then made sure I understood and got them the correct measurements . ( She's shorter than what the avg person is in the size she needed so they were just verifying. )This dress is EVERYTHING. Seriously is beautiful stitched. It's a perfect fit for her. I was expecting the dress to be itchy and it's not. The bodice has a bra band sewn in. The only thing that id change is the color . I know that the computer screen can show different colors but I orders teal and it's pretty blue . See photos. Those were unedited . It's still beautiful and we love it but it's not the teal color we wanted.,119,47,Kidswear,4.5,,8,0.0003

The rings had a wonderful feel to them and my 1 year old loved playing with the rings. Then I read the amazon reviews about how each ring has a different texture and weight etc...I immediately ordered the rings for my baby. I was extremely disappointed when I received my rings and I wrote to the company to complain and ask for an exchange. They said that all their rings are made out of this material-HARD PLASTIC. I know this is not true, because  I felt the rings with my hands. I am assuming that the company recently downgraded and changed the material from the nice rubber to this junky plastic. Many previous reviews talk about how 1 of the rings are spongyish...mine isn't etc. My rings look the same, but do NOT feel the same.

2023-08-13,True,5,"It is easy to get dragged along onto the gloom train that is the current Power Rangers fandom. It felt like a lot of people were waiting for this thing with dread as much as excitement. As such, my hopes for this toy were not too high, but the more time I spend with the Cosmic Fury Megazord, the more I like it.Yes, it’s a barely articulated brick, and that is disappointing in contrast to the excellent articulation in (some of) the prior Dino Fury line, and in contrast to the general standards that Hasbro has set across their toylines.The Dino Fury zords, as a reminder, were atypical, eschewing a lot of classic design elements to create something sleek, modular, and highly articulated. They were incredible toys, but in fairness, when they were all put together, the Dino Fury Megazords could look like kind of a mess. Even in the show. Especially in certain configurations. The array of individual zords was a mishmash of different sizes, and most did not have amazing articulation by themselves. Some were essentially just dinosaur shaped Lego blocks that got stuck onto another zord.They’re following that up with something much more traditional here, albeit with a continued emphasis on modularity. Cosmic Fury Megazord is stiff, blocky, stocky, chonky, cheesy, cool and uncomplicated.The red zord is a funky lion spaceship that forms the torso and the head for the Megazord. The other four zords are different animal-vehicle hybrids that can all work interchangeably as arms or legs. Red can also be converted into its own stand-alone humanoid form which dual-wields the pair of giant swords that are included in the box.It’s very neat and easy to understand and it has a pleasant uniformity in its mechanics that offsets its asymmetrical, wonky style. All of it looks very cool. The individual zords look cool, and the full Megazord looks cool. It looks better in person than it does in pictures or videos. While the Dino Fury line was enjoyably cerebral (if sometimes tedious to work with), the Cosmic Fury line is just fun and inviting, and I want to play with it.Articulation is almost non-existent. Forget about ankles. Nothing moves under the waist. No knees, no wrists, no elbows. Waist, shoulders, and head can do a three-sixty. Individual zords have just enough moving pieces to allow them to be folded into a vague approximation of a limb, and that’s it.And all of that is fine! This toy is awesome. The Cosmic Fury Megazord teeters precariously on whatever feet you stick under it, but it actually stands quite sturdily. It rocks, but doesn’t topple too easily. That sturdiness, combined with its simple transformation mechanics, makes it a great choice for younger kids; it might be the best little-kid toy that any Power Rangers line has ever produced, and for that particular demographic, its lack of articulation is barely relevant. It does, after all, say “4+” on the box. Then again, anybody with a bit of cleverness can actually find some fun potential hidden within its limited articulation options and those Voltron-esque arms-that-end-in-animal-faces-instead-of-hands. This Megazord can’t actually grasp a sword by the handle, but I noticed a bunch of small peg holes all over the individual zords that could accommodate the pegs on the sides of the swords, and immediately started prototyping ideas for a whirling Mega-murder-zord.The Cosmic Fury Megazord shares the Zord-link system that was introduced in the Dino Fury line. What does this actually mean?Well, the Cosmic Fury Megazord has these big colorful orbs that connect at the lion’s shoulders and knees - using new, proprietary connectors - and then those orbs have Zord-link connectors that connect to the other zords to form the limbs of the Megazord.In contrast, the zords in the Dino Fury line were all just blanketed in Zord-link connectors (giving them their Lego-like aesthetic) so that you could stick the smaller zords all over the bigger humanoid zords to, essentially, equip them with big colorful weapons.There is a lot of potential for cross-play, although interchangeability between the lines does not work quite as well as one might hope. The biggest issue here is that the larger humanoid Dino Fury zords are all covered in male connectors, and the connectors on the Cosmic Fury limb-forming zords are also all male, so the capacity for retrofitting Cosmic Fury zords onto Dino Fury Megazords is disappointingly limited. But the smaller Dino Fury zords, with their plethora of connectors, do offer the Cosmic Fury Megazord a bunch of additional limb options, and you can stick the Cosmic Fury orb pieces all over the Dino Fury zords to achieve some cool (or silly) new looks. Overall, in spite of my complaints, if you have the Dino Fury zords, then the Cosmic Fury Megazord is simply a must-have. Mixing the two lines together is a blast.The Cosmic Fury Megazord pack is priced the same as the older Dino Fury Megazord pack even though the Dino Fury pack came with more plastic in it, produced a larger Megazord, and had much better articulation and more plentiful and complex combination options. Hasbro also sells Transformers toys for less than a hundred dollars that are about the same size as a Megazord and feature much more complex engineering along with mind-melting levels of articulation. Are they asking for too much money for this toy?What this offers in place of everything it doesn’t have is, mainly, great robustness. This is a toy that seems like it is going to be able to get smashed against other toys for years without critically breaking, again reinforcing the Cosmic Fury Megazord’s highest purpose as a young children’s toy.It also seems like Hasbro may have dialed in the quality of the Zord-link connectors compared to the previous line, as I find that all of the limb-forming zords come on and off easily enough without feeling too loose while they’re connected. The Dino Fury zord toys were notorious for randomly having some connectors that took a lot of force to attach while other connectors had trouble staying attached (and, indeed, I have found that interconnections between the two lines can be hampered by Dino Fury’s quality control issues).In the end, Hasbro made almost no concessions to adult fans with this toy, and that definitely might mean that it’s not worth the price to some. I do think the quality is there, and the designers/engineers just had different priorities from what some people would have preferred. I’m extremely pleased with this toy, and we are having tons of fun with it at my house.",2,2,Toys,3.0,,2,0.0097

2022-08-23,True,5,"So, I've struggled with several issues over the years. I've felt fatigued and doctors couldn't figure out why. I also developed weak teeth. They seemed to break off easily even though I take really good care of them. Then, every since my early 20's I've felt the need to urinate way more than I should have to. Sometimes before bed I'd have to get up 5+ times or I'd feel the urge to urinate even if it was only a drop or two.I know that doctors don't test for trace minerals and they REALLY should. I think a lot of people are low in them. In the US the government doesn't require farms to put most trace minerals back into the soil. This is an issue especially with the mass corporate farming. So we aren't getting the minerals from our food anymore. This can lead to a lot of health issues and doctors never test for it. Instead, they just treat symptoms with prescription meds.So, I took these just to see if they helped with anything. I didn't really expect to notice any difference. I wasn't looking to ""cure"" the problems I mentioned above. I'd lived with those so long that I thought that was just how I was or was genetics. However, after the very first pill I noticed my urge to urinate drastically decrease. It was very noticible. I felt relief for the first time in years. This got better and better in the following days. I ended up being fully cured of my urge to urinate after suffering for about 15 years with it. I also noticed my teeth getting stronger. They were whiter too. I'm only 35 years old, but my teeth felt like they were on their last legs. Suddenly, after a few weeks, my teeth felt like they did back in my early 20's. They felt strong and not like they would easily crack off. I had a little hole in one of my teeth that had rubbed away due to brushing and no matter how gentle I was...it wouldn't fill in. It's completely gone now. I also suddenly felt filled with energy. I haven't felt this good in years.I'm really sad that I spent about fifteen years of my youth feel bad all because I apparently was low on one or more of these trace minerals. It's a travesty that the medical community doesn't take this more seriously. You can find a lot of studies on PubMed showing that they KNOW most of the population is low in these trace minerals. Yet, they do nothing. Likely because it creates profitable medical problems for them to ""treat"" with prescriptions. It's not profitable for the doctors or big pharma if we suddenly were more healthy and had the trace minerals our bodies require. It makes me so mad.",2511,144,Health Supplements,4.7,,231,0.0

As for results, I can't say I have noticed a huge difference just yet but saying that, as with all supplements, you do need to give them time to work. As a rule, most supplements take a couple of months before you might begin to notice a difference.I do think this particular brand is a trusted one mainly due to the ingredient content.

The issue I had was I started getting discomfort and which was accompanied by bleeding. ((it wasn’t that time of the month))). I stopped taking them. The bleeding stopped after a day or 2. Then I thought maybe my period was just thrown off. I tried them out again. Then again I started using them again. It happened again discomfort and bleeding. It wasn't like pouring blood or anything Just very light bleeding. But they did make the bloating go away which I really liked.,1035,63,Health Supplements,4.1,,14,0.0029

I finally did some research on this product to see if this might make a difference. I have been on this probiotic for just about a week and I have noticed a difference with my stomach!

I have had a lot less cravings for food and have been eating a lot less than I was before, and overall, I just feel sooo much better!

I have definitely noticed a somewhat significant change when I wake up in the morning and throughout the day- I hardly ever wake up feeling bloated- which is a serious change compared to before I started taking this product,  waking up most days looking three months pregnant. I take two capsules before I go to bed, and may take one in the morning or before a large meal if I'm feeling bloated.**RECOMMEND: try for yourself as every supplement is different, and even more so- everyone's body reacts differently. This product may work wonders for someone and do nothing for another. Regardless I definitely recommend trying these out before/over other brands!I wanted to add that I have also tried ""HUM Nutrition's"" products that claim to produce similar results. Let me just say- their products are awful. They made me so sick and nauseous the first time around, and that’s when I began taking these instead. When I ran out of ""Bye Bye Bloat"" I gave them another try, and they ended up making me VIOLENTLY SICK. I vomited for hours and looked/felt so ill that my family tried convincing me to go to the hospital. If you are weighing your options between Digestive Supplements- I highly recommend these, the Love Wellness Bye, Bye, Bloat- over anything else I have tried.Pro's:- An easily noticeable change in decreased bloating- Improved digestion !!!- more regular bowel movements- I have IBS and this doesn't seem to disrupt it- ""morning skinny""Con's:- They smell very odd. I have to plug my nose to take them as the scent makes me borderline nauseous...- The first few days I took this I experienced very slight nausea- The capsules are pretty large, so if you have problems swallowing pills these aren't a good option.- A bit pricey for only lasting 2-4 weeks per the recommended dose",5972,548,Health Supplements,4.1,,85,0.0

My stomach feels less distended and I do think it helps with digestion. I don’t notice the effects quite as much after 2 months of taking, but that could be that I’m just used to it now. I think if I stopped taking it I would definitely miss it. The taste is something I have a hard time getting used to, but I just take it with something besides water to try and mask the taste.

But I've had to dial in the dosage for what works for me. The instructions recommend to start with 1 per day for a few days, and them gradually add one for a few days until you work up to three per day. Personally, three per day was like that old SNL skit, Colon Blow. Too much! After some trial and error I found that one per day, occasionally taking two every 3-4 days, is the right amount for me.

Waste has elastic draws you can button in to fit which is a big plus. Older two are long and lean with 3 year old typical toddler body. Elastic adjusted to fit perfectly at their waists. They were all too long so folded hems - after I opened side seams to new length. Then when resown- not a wrinkle. Even though one had to be shortened 5”. Looks perfect. Also- to have jacket perfect fit on 5 y/o, I needed to size up so pants a bit big. I easily took up the pant sides from below elastic waist to bottom- 1/2” and now fits perfectly. Groomsmen are wearing navy bow ties- I easily found some on Amazon for the boys.

I don’t think I noticed they were slim fit because my thin size 8 boys suit fit him perfectly maybe just an inch too long on the pants, but my size 12 boy who is more of a regular fit was extremely tight. We somehow managed to get the zipper and button to stay, but there was no way the vest was going to close and we never did get the top button to close. In the 2 hours of the car ride and finishing the ceremony his pants had ripped twice at the crotch seam and were tearing apart and the side of his thigh.

The waistband on the pants was still too large but would have worked but the suit (in my opinion) was still on the baggy side of what I was hoping for and much more importantly the jacket sleeves and pant legs were about an inch too short!

However, since they have an adjustable waistband (yay!!), we were able to make them fit. Otherwise, it fit perfectly, and he looks so handsome! Our one quibble might be with the adjustable necktie. I've never tried one on him before, so maybe it's par for the course, but it was hard to find the piece to adjust it and then it keeps loosening. That's a minor inconvenience for us, however.

The pants had the right length for all of the sizes - might need to hem them an inch. The jacket was just right for size 4. Would have been nice if it was a tad bigger but not willing to go to the 5 which will be much too big.

2021-05-16,True,5,"Needed First Communion outfits for my twin grandsons.  I priced the cost of dress pants, a button down shirt and a tie bought separately and it was more than this outfit that also included the vest.  The boys each chose the color they wanted and one ended up in Navy blue and the other chose the darker gray.  When I saw the size chart it made me panic.  The weights listed put each boy 2 sizes smaller than what we normally buy for them.  Timing was tight so I bought 5 different outfits in various sizes.  As it turned out, they ended up with the bigger sizes that they normally wear. The pants were plenty long and since the boys are slender, the waists fit in the smaller sizes.  But the vest runs narrow.  One boy couldn't have worn the smaller vest in the recommended size and the other boy just looked better in the bigger vest.  The waists are adjustable so we just tightened the waists and hemmed the pants legs and the bigger sizes worked fine.  The boys looked great.  For dress shoes I recommend Sonoma Good for Life Boys Slip on Shoes from Kohl's.  They look nice and they are comfortable.

Be sure to cut all the loose strings left before use and you may want to dry clean (we did) to clear manufacturing smells out before first use.  Warning: if your kid is plump in the mid-driff this may NOT be the suit for you since buying a bigger size will also increase leg and arm lengths as well.

The size of the jacket was good just a little long on the arms but we fixed that and he looked amazing!  We did not use the tie it comes with, I bough an actual tie for him to wear.

Vest was ok but the sewing in the back of the vest was not done correctly and I couldn’t make the vest tight or wide at any point. Jacket was nice and sturdy.

The vest fit well, which is what I was most worried about as the vests in these outfit combos tends to be smaller (in my experience with other kids). The shirt was a little big and the pants were a little too long and a little big around the waist. If you are not wanting more than one use, or if all of the uses are fairly close together, I'd order the actual size of the child and it will probably be great. As for us, the pant legs weren't too long to be functional as long as he kept his shoes on and you could do a safety pin at the waist or a couple of whipstitches with needle and thread.

I ordered a 4T, but it almost looks like it should be a 5T. It's definitely big on my little guy because of that, but it's still wearable for him without looking liking he's drowning in it. Its just really long compared to other coats (which isn't a bad thing when it comes to staying warm during the New England winter). Apart from the large sizing, the coat itself is a bit bulky (not just b/c its large for him). It's not like puffy coat bulky, but its too bulky to wear and safely strap him into his seat. I tend to take it off him before I strap him in.This coat also washes very well. 2 weeks after he got it, he came home from his father's with 4 giant 4/5"" wide stains of what looked llike black ink. I thought for sure it wasn't going to come out, but it came out very easily and quickly when I soaked it in a sink w/ oxy clean. As soon as it hit the water the stain started to lift.

Of course no returns. And afraid to offer them to anyone else to try because I don't want anyone to have same problems.

I have a poor diet, lack exercise (yes I understand exercise will change my life, but I'm too tired and failed consistently on a routine) and deal with debilitating depression as well as mental fog. After a long road of opiate addiction, I felt like I have never got my normal energy back. I have tried other supplements including multi vitamins, vitamin D and B12 over the years, but its hard for me to make work on time or leave my house. I am chronically late.

A coworker was telling me how he was taking vitamin B1 and had to stop because he had so much energy he couldn't sleep. Well, I knew I needed to find some! I have taken sleeping pills most of my life and still currently do, so I knew I was already on something that would put me to sleep regardless. I love this liquid form and it doesn't taste bad like other things I have got in liquid form. I started with the small dropper bottle and I take a dose every morning. Within a few days my husband started asking me where I am getting my energy from because he saw a noticeable difference in me. I hadn't told him I got this to try and started taking it because I didn't know if it would even work. I have been consistently disappointed over the years of thinking I found something that actually helped. Normally coming home from work, I'm tired and dont want to do anything. Now I'm actually getting to work early (an HOUR early mind you every day this week!!) and I have energy after. Both my husband, mother and son now want their own after seeing the big difference it made for me. I got the bigger bottle to refill my dropper. Its a bit pricey but this routine has changed my life drastically. Its totally worth it for me. I dont even take it on weekends because 5 days a week keeps a good level for me.

I checked the local music store and for almost the same price as these, their offer was one of those ubiquitous cheapie chrome stands that should retail for about twelve bucks. I read some reviews and decided to try this one out. I've used it on a gig already and it's just fine. Looks a lot nicer than those chrome stand and is only a couple dollars more, plus it includes a USB powered stand light with two gooseneck lights (one for each page of a 2-page spread) that clips to the stand. I'd expect to pay at least 10 bucks for the light alone. A cute music design clip is included also to hold a book open or whatever. I won't use it but someone might. As if that wasn't enough for less than $30, a decent carry bag is also included, which has some extra space so I can throw my binder in also.Assembly and takedown is super easy, just two parts, and the top of the stand is ratchet-adjustable so you can angle your music perfectly. It's not the sturdiest stand, but it's adjustable to really any height a musician would want, and it stays in place when tightened.

2020-07-21,True,4,"for a similar price to the typical non-folding music stand you see in schools, this holds up pretty well.cons: the only cons to this are that the stand itself has a lot of telescoping joints, so the connections aren't quite as sturdy as a standard music stand. that said, it's not like the stand is flimsy, it's not. unless you play a lot of outdoor gigs with strong winds or something, you won't see any substantial problems with its sturdiness.pros: though the telescoping joints take a hit on sturdiness, they add a pro in the stand's easy adjustability and its ability to be fully solid while at a taller maximum height than a standard music stand. on top of that (literally) the music holder segment of the stand comes on and off very easily, without compromising its stability. the spring-loaded retainers are also great, as they hold the music down with plenty of force, but because they're springs, can easily be lifted and adjusted - much better designed than the thin rotating rods you see on folding stand heads. what's great about the stand is that it's very portable. not as portable as the folding stands that collapse into a small cylindrical case, granted, but portable enough for most cases. at that point you either compromise on sturdiness or portability, and this stand seems like a good in between. it's also nice that they add in a stand light, which can be AAA battery powered, or usb powered, as well as a big clip. overall, if you want a stand that's a good compromise between both sturdy and portable, this is a great one for the price",66,24,Musical Instruments,4.3,,2,0.0004

The USB cable is used to charge the battery, which is great since it makes the lights portable with no fuss.LOTMUSIC: As for this lotmusic stand, the usb cable serves as a power cable and doesn't charge anything. Instead, the LED lights require 3 AAA batteries.I should have noticed this on the product description, so that was my mistake.

The light is cool looking with two protruding tentacle like light that can be manipulated and bent to the users preference.The main area where the  sheet music is clipped on is not at all top heavy but super light in turn allowing the tripod area to not be thick and heavy. I like how there are multiple adjustment knobs for fine tuning the positioning. The back main part simply slides into the tripod top area then is fastened in by one of the knobs.There are plastic boot coverings on the legs as can be seen in one of the pictures i have included. This is essential for areas that have a smooth surface. If you play out a lot you will most likely end up with a slippery surface at some point so the rubber ends can be helpful.I like the area you have to work with in relation to the area where paper is placed. The height of this area allows me to clamp extra things on there with mini clamps. I like to use reference sheets because i am not classically trained so i like the ability to be able to stick my many notes of reference all around the stand.In conclusion i am very glad i own this and recommend it to music people everywhere.,66,24,Musical Instruments,4.3,,0,0.0001
2020-08-23,False,4,"I have been using a  stand for a few years now, since I travel to three different community bands.  It did not come with a carry bag, but you can  for about $20.

Unlike the Manhasset, the top of the stand will easily slide on and off and does not pop off easily when you are pulling the stand up higher.  I like the attached music holders that are spring-loaded, and appreciate the stand light and music clip included.  Just a couple worries though -- there is no 'lip' on the columns to keep them from coming detached, so if you pull the stand up too high, the columns separate and your music is on the floor (with a loud bang).

2020-11-23,True,4,"It's everything the description makes it out to be, and overall I'm very pleased with it. It doesn't feel cheap or flimsy, and I can tell it will last me a good while.The tripod structure doesn't wobble around and seems to be pretty sturdy. The height is easy to adjust and spans more than enough height needed for both sitting and standing. The angle of the main top bit is also adjustable. The only adjustment I wish this had was a separate rotational component so you could easily rotate the top of stand. To do so currently, you need to loosen the top most height stopper and rotate the whole pipe, which is by no means the end of the world, but that means you'll have to keep a handle on the height too while doing this.The lights it comes with are fantastic. Each head of the light has an individual button switch which changes between three states: off, dimmer light, brighter light. The photograph shows the brighter light state. The fact that it can be USB or battery driven is really handy.The cable it comes with for USB power is not particularly long however, so even at the sitting height I took the picture at, I wouldn't be able to reach the power outlet given the length of that cable. If you're intending to use USB power for the light, you'll most likely need a USB power bank. You'll also need to figure out where to place said power bank so it doesn't get in the way.The main bit of the stand arrived with a pretty substantial dent, but that's the fault of the carrier/handler rather than a drawback of the product.

The top part can be bent forward and backwards (see video) and has a lip that can hold pens and pencils.The whole thing is magnetic, so I can have magnets and timers with a magnetic strap on it attached to the base of the music stand (see pictures). It has two little black securers that hold my papers in place. Please note, the top that holds the papers is very easy to tip over, as sturdy as the base is, the top can tip and cause papers to fall down. This happens if you walk by it and your hips graze it, so be mindful when walking around this. Otherwise, unless you accidentally tip the top portion too forward, it will stay in place. It's excellent, it's an excellent price and I appreciate the material construction of it. It makes playing an instrument so much easier since I can be seated and have all of my sheet music right next to me. The lip is enough to hold a phone and pens and pencils as well. I couldn't recommend this enough, it works perfectly and I love it!My only complaint are the additional lights that come with it. The buttons to turn them on are a little bit of a challenge to press, you have to press it the right way to get the light showing. The light itself is pretty good, and I'm happy with it being battery powered, I suspect they will last a long time. One click on the light gives a good amount of light, clicking the button again yields an even brighter light (see video). I also love the little music clip, it keeps all of my papers attached to the base. I appreciate all of the add-ins alongside this excellent music stand!The video shows me struggling to put the timer back on the music stand, this is not a good representation of the music stand's magnetic qualities, the paper and plastic sleeves were getting in the way, not giving enough real estate for the magnets to attach.

The PC runs smoothly and handles demanding games without any major issues. The graphics card and processor combination deliver decent gaming experiences with respectable frame rates.However, there are a few aspects that could be improved. Firstly, the packaging could have been better. Although the PC arrived in working condition, the packaging was subpar and lacked proper protection. Secondly, the aesthetics of the PC could have been more appealing. It feels a bit outdated and lacks the sleek design that is often associated with gaming PCs.Another minor drawback is the limited upgrade options. While the PC performs well for now, it may become obsolete sooner than expected due to its limited upgradability. It would have been great if there were more options to enhance its performance and keep up with future gaming demands.On the positive side, the price point for this refurbished HP gaming PC was reasonable, making it an attractive option for budget-conscious gamers. Additionally, the customer service provided by the seller was satisfactory, as they promptly responded to my inquiries and addressed my concerns.if you're looking for a budget-friendly gaming PC with decent performance, this refurbished HP model is worth considering.

The S7 is very powerful and is sometimes great in the sunlight, sometimes it just fades to almost unviewable.  I have started using the tablet in a construction zone for reports and other things, so I have been looking for a while, for one that was under $200, good in direct sunlight and over 10 inches.  This one, at least on paper ticked all of the boxes.  The last refurbished tables I bought, the battery was dead after 1 hour, but i decided to take a chance on this one.  I am so glade that I did.  This one in direct sunlight is easier to read, then my Tab S7, and after 10 hours of constant use, I still had 30% battery life left.  The other benefit of the tablet is it comes standard with a protective case, so no need to buy one later.  The only thing that i have noticed is that this one is not as fast as the Tab S7, but for filling out forms and spread sheets, it is more than fast enough, and if I happen to drop it and break it, it will not cost me near as much to replace.If you are looking for a gaming tablet, the Tab S7/S8 are a much better fit, but if you are looking for something with a great battery life and productivity or surfing the internet, then this one is a much better choice.",283,46,Laptops and Tablets,4.4,,15,0.0002

These plugs are located exclusively in bathrooms and only in some hotels. Furthermore, the adapter is heavy. For us, that meant that the adapter sagged in the shaver plug (in multiple hotels in the UK) even without any additional cords attached. Once cords were attached, the weight of those cords made it sag so much that it was no longer connected to any electricity. Incredibly frustrating. We did have better luck with the electricity making a connection in France, but still only our smart watches and phones charged. Our electric toothbrush would not charge and my hair dryer (EU voltage friendly) would not work at all with this adapter. All in all, we can't recommend it.

2019-08-29,True,4,"First of all, who picked ""Drying Power"" as a characteristic of a Travel Adapter. Really? Is this how we buy little things that plug into outlets when we're in Switzerland? By their Drying Power? For crying out loud; if you're going to have suggested attributes of products, you have to know the tiniest bit about how the things are used.But I digress...The problem here is two-fold. 1) this is a heavy converter/adapter, so if you're using the plug with the two little smooth ""rods"" for conductors, there's not enough friction in the outlet to keep the entire rig from capsizing. This is exacerbated by the use of an Apple power cube or some other item that additionally plugs into the converter. The entire lump will slowing extricate itself from the 220V outlet and plop on the floor, and then you wake up and your PHONE IS NOT CHARGED and if you're 18 years old, and missing your boyfriend, that's tragic. (I should point out that I only know this from my kids, and I wish this would happen more often frankly, but no one asks me...)The second issue is that one of the plug (I can't exactly remember, but it might be the English plug) requires that you PRESS the slider button to get the prongs to come out. No press; no prongs. You have to know this arcane bit of dexterity or nothing pops out, or you won't be making coffee or charging your iPod in Jolly Olde England. To appreciate this, travel with my wife and tell her she can't have coffee tomorrow because you can't figure out a $15 travel converter. It doesn't go well.",1166,332,Tools,4.6,,3,0.0001
2019-06-19,True,4,"We recently have been doing a lot of international travel. We purchased two of these items and have been very happy with the results. We travel extensively throughout Europe and used the European settings for the device. It worked perfectly and allowed us to change numerous devices. I had a phone, CPAP, external battery source, and vapor pipe all plugged into the unit at once every night during our travels. The unit worked exactly as it should. There are multiple settings for different world power requirements. Each of us using the device found it to function well. The only drawback to the European configuration is there is no plastic insert to put on the device to make it feel like it fits snug, but this was not an issue with function. Just be sure you place the device into the wall socket firmly and you will have no issues with using it. There are plenty of USB charging ports and that was very handy for me since I do tend to travel with a lot of mobile electronic devices. But I was able to travel for 3 weeks using this device and charging all of my electronics and powering my CPAP machine for use at night all at the same time. The device is very easy to use, you simply pick the power type you need to use and the prongs extend from the unit to plug into the available socket.",1166,332,Tools,4.6,,2,0.0028
2019-09-30,True,4,"I just returned from Iceland and used the 2-prong portion of this. Luckily there was one location in the hotel that didn't have an indented socket area. Most sockets over there have a circle ""cut-out"" if you will, with the 2-prong female part inside it. If this was the only option at the hotel, this unit would not have worked, since the prongs wouldn't have been long enough to push in, and considering that part of the unit is square without a circular area to mold into it. (does that make sense?) BUT, the all-in-one is a fantastic feature for travel and packing. Not a ton of pieces to deal with or to lose.  After the hotel, we stayed in an Air B&B and they had adapters to use with this unit. It worked great there.  I'd say, if this unit had pop-outs that match with the outlets in the different countries, this would be IDEAL and I'd have given it a 5 star. But because I had to rely on ""hopefully's"", I gave it a 4 star because it DID work and was quite handy. Especially with its own little carry case. LOVE that!",1166,332,Tools,4.6,,2,0.0003
2018-07-01,True,4,"Thanks Amazon and Sublime Ware! As I was finishing organizing my packing for a two week trip abroad, I realized I could not find my bag of power adaptors. Oops! Quick! To Amazon! This amazingly multipurpose adaptor popped up and while it seemed large and a trifle heavy (compared to my past experience), it seemed very versatile. It'll do! It arrived on time, as promised. Hoping it would work, I stuck it in the suitcase and headed for the airport, not even opening it until I reached my first hotel room in London.  Others have left detailed descriptions of its functionality, which I confirm. I was pleasantly surprised to see it has a nice carrying case and is cleverly designed to replace multiple adaptors. I didn't even need the instructions to figure out what to do. Works like a charm. So far, I've only used the British connection, but I assume the other styles will work equally well.  My only caveat is that, as described elsewhere, it might tend to pull out of a U.S. vertical plug, if a ""heavy"" charger (like for my MacAir) is plugged into it.

In the past I've travelled with a bag of plugs that you swap onto a universal adapter, whereas this is an all-in-one that can pop out whichever plug type is appropriate for the available outlet.  Small enough to cram in the corner of any overpacked bag.  It feels sturdy, and will hopefully stand up to many future trips.My only criticism is that although it offers two 2.4A USB ports and two 2.1A, the actual maximum current is 3.5A.  So, if you have 2 devices actively charging via USB, the most either device will actually see is 1.75A.  The reduced charging rate is quite noticeable when you're trying to quickly top up your phone and backup battery simultaneously before heading back out for the day.  I think the labeling is a bit misleading as a result.",1166,332,Tools,4.6,,10,0.0015

If you forget to set this, the plugs may not fully extend/lock properly.

The deal:  This thing is a pretty good multi-port usb charger.  It is a PRETTY TERRIBLE power converter for any appliance that draws more power than a light bulb.  If you plug in a hair blower, it will fail, and you will be left, in a foreign country, dripping wet, wondering why in blazes this POS is not working.Here is what I did.  After it failed I contacted the Amazon tech service link to chat with someone who was very polite, but did not know didley.  I then found a small opening in the back that revealed a blown fuse, and a spare fuse.  Perhaps it was just a bad fuse?  Nope.  The replacement fuse failed as well.  Much cursing and disparaging the manufacturer's reason for existence.  Next, strip the foil from a food package and roll it tightly into the shape of the blown fuses to make a shunt, put the shunt into the fuse holder and, ""voila"", back in business.Lesson?  WTF? Over.  It is just a power converter.  It makes no sense to limit its power via the fuse to 3.5 amps when a typical power outlet is rated at 15-20 amps, especially when most portable hair blowers use 15 - 17 amps.So, again, don't buy this thing if you intend to use if for more than a usb charger.",361,228,Tools,4.6,,7,0.0001

I was told that the adapter works perfectly with low voltage equipment.  My equipment is 100-120V so it is the adapter that is at fault.

2018-07-27,True,5,"The SublimeWare Model 304 (hyperlink listed below) is a must-have electronics gadget for anyone who travels to multiple continents and countries around the world. The adapter offers three main country options, e.g. USA/AUS, UK, and EU, but any country compatible with these three protocols will likely be supported as well. SublimeWare claims that the adapter will work in as many as 150 countries world-wide. NOTE: the Model 304 is only a plug adapter and not a power converter. Hence, it should work well with any dual-band, high tech device that is designed for 110-240 volt and 50-60 hertz power input. This could include many laptop computers, tablets, and smartphones, but it is best to check the actual power requirements for the device that is printed somewhere on the chassis or ac/dc charger (i.e. ""brick""). If you cannot locate this information on the device itself, then an online source might be the next best option, if and only if you can identify the exact same item and model number. Conversely, many legacy devices like hair dryers, curling irons, portable alarm clocks, small personal fans, etc. most likely will not work correctly without the use of a power converter in addition to the plug adapter. If this is the case, then one should do thorough research and due diligence when selecting the right power converter for the destination in question.The Model 304 is approximately 1-1/2"" by 1-1/2"" by 2"" in size, or slightly smaller than a tennis ball if it were ""squared off."" Three different outlet plug configurations can be selected, one at a time, by using sliders on one side of the adapter. The release catch is located on the opposite side of the adapter, and only slight pressure is needed to press the tab and gently push the pins back into the case for storage and travel. You may notice a small black switch on the front of the adapter (i.e. the side that the pins protrude from) that changes depending on the sliders used for choosing the country, but it is an Auto Control Switch and functions, well, automatically. One standard electrical cord can be plugged into the back of the adapter, and up to four USB devices can be plugged into the top of the adapter, all at she same time if  desirable. So if travel space and simplicity are a premium, test out your devices on this adapter at home, and then leave all of the chargers that use USB connections at home...but not your laptop brick and cord 'eh. For those of you who live (and die) by Murphy's Law, you might want to purchase and carry two of these handy little multi-function adapters during your travels. Remember, redundancy was an integral part of NASA's Apollo missions to the moon, and I would bet that they used a backup device or process at least once in the course of the six successful moon landings (11, 12, 14, 15, 16, and 17). You might even keep one of the two adapters in your favorite carry-on luggage in between flights to avoid the, ""Oh, crap! I left my adapter at home,"" right about the time you pull up to Departures/Ticketing/Gates.So, all in all, this international travel electronics plug adapter is small but mighty. If you have numerous adapters already, adding this one can simplify your travel life. If you're in the market for your first travel adapter, then this one would be hard to pass up. Just remember...a plug adapter is not a power converter. The simple rule is: you will always need a plug adapter when traveling abroad to non-USA/AUS locales (or even the US if you like the four USB connection option); you might also need a separate power converter depending on circumstances. Basically, know before you go, and test everything at home before you ""fly the friendly skies"" (or head off ""into the wild blue yonder""...your call on which cliche fits best).",8738,3649,Tools,4.6,,73,0.00115

So far, it has matched up to all the outlet types we've come across, which of course is not the entire spectrum of plug types and power levels.  But this thing certainly does all the major plug/power types.  The USB outlets provide fast charging (high power mode) for smart phones and tablets capable of accepting and regulating high power fast charging, I have been very pleased at the charging power and speeds from the USB outlets.PROS:* Very compact device.  I've had several items like this over the years, and this is the smallest I've yet found - but it still has all the normal/common plugs and connectors for major US, European, and Far Eastern plugs that I've come across.* It has all the normal outlet and power levels covered, as I've said.  Very cool for such a small power cube.* The LED is not blinding.  You may shrug and say ""so what?"", but if you've ever had one of those USB power cubes with LEDs capable of taking satellites out of orbit if focused properly, you'll understand why I don't need a huge blob of light lighting up the ceiling or wall of my hotel room or bedroom when I'm trying to sleep.  This is present, but not too bright, at least to me.* The different plug types lock into place once you slide them out, and you might well say ""of course they do, how else can it work?""  Well, I had a converter like this that relied on friction, and over time, friction failed.  It was almost impossible to plug in, as the plug blades would slide back into the cube when the going got tough.  This locking mechanism is both easy to use, and simple to unlock when putting it all away.  Kudos for a simple but effective blade lock.* Modest price.  It isn't free, but it's certainly not the costliest power converter/adapter out there.  It's a bargain, if you take into account that you DON'T have to buy another $12-$20 USB charger on top of a power adapter, since it has 4 USB outlets.  Great value, in my book.CONS:*  Hmmm...  Coming up blank here.  If anything untoward develops, I'll edit this review to include it, but as of this writing, I really have no dings to mention.  Time will tell.Really, this thing is head and shoulders above competing products I've had before.

They are glass so I don’t have to worry about breaking it getting it in and out of the cabinet.  Easy peasy. I’m happy so far. If it detoxed my face it must be doing something! I use it on my neck and décolletage too. Il update as I go!",10893,1507,Beauty,4.4,,27,0.0
2023-03-15,True,4,"I followed the instructions given on the box along with a routine and haven’t really noticed that much change so far but I did just start using it. So far none of them have clogged my pores, however the hyaluronic acid and retinol (especially the retinol) have both caused my skin some pain and irritation immediately after use. Though, I’m able to calm the pain down with a moisturizer. The vitamin c works fine and doesn’t give me any burns. I also have sensitive combination skin due my eczema so I can’t speak for those without sensitive skin. Overall not too bad if you follow with a routine and make sure to put on a good moisturizer after. If that doesn’t work I recommend making your face damp before applying the hyaluronic acid and retinol. Also, I haven’t used it that much since I got it so it could be my skin isn’t used to it yet.",10893,1507,Beauty,4.4,,11,0.0002

2022-07-29,True,4,"Update: October 9 2022: I’m back to make my 3rd purchase of this trio. So far the trio continues to keep my face and neck clear and toned looking. The laugh lines have faded/soften significantly. I still think that for the price and with a consistent routine, this trio is more than worth the money spent for this trio.Original review:  I purchased this trio in March 2022 and started using according to instructions I found online. The package I received had a note attached that instructed, “contact us for a Full Beauty User Guide.” Instead I read a few online instructions from estheticians as to how to use these three products together.  I used the Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid in the morning with moisturizer  and all three at night with moisturizer. I also used either Rosehip oil or jojoba oil with my moisturizer because of retinol drying effects. I’m older and have dry sensitive skin. I began noticing a positive change after 4 or5 days. After 2 weeks the positive change could be clearly seen. After 3.5 months, I had finished using all three products. Today I am purchasing the trio again. The trio has made a huge difference in how my face and neck look. My skin is clearer and looks toned/tighter. The laugh line from nose to near the mouth is much much softer just about half gone in fact. I am surprised that these three products has taken years off my face and neck. One thing that probably applies only to my sensitive skin. I could not apply the Vit C and the Retinol to the area near my eyebrows and between my eyebrows and around or near my nose. But these areas might be sensitive for most people.If you are debating whether or not to try this product, give it a try. The cost alone is worth it. You might get lucky and it might work for you like it has worked for me.",10893,1507,Beauty,4.4,,41,0.0
2022-05-31,True,2,"My usual skincare routine is very expensive, so I was looking for something that would be simple and more cost-effective. I have never had great skin, I think partially because my immune system is compromised. I have a lot of scarring, discoloration and annoying hormonal breakouts even though my period has ceased. But I had finally found a routine of salicylic acid, mandelic acid, hyaluronic acid and a retinoid that seemed to work to keep my skin looking...so-so.  I also did a 40 percent mandelic acid peel every 8 to 12weeks. This had been my routine for the last 3-4 years. But my skin had been changing these last few months; becoming drier over and a few more lines starting to develop around my eyes and mouth. So I thought a change was in order. After reading dozens upon dozens of reviews and doing some outside research online, I decided to take a chance on this 3 serum routine. I diligently tried a routine of vitamin C, hyaluronic acid and my usual SPF 50 from Japan in the mornings and hyaluronic acid and retinol in the evening for about six weeks, getting about half way through the bottles. I used my usual gentile cleanser and initially my usual moisturizer at night as well. I didn't do a chemical peel during this time.The first thing I noticed after a few days was that my skin seemed a lot oilier.  I was surprised and stopped using my moisturizer at night since it seemed like it was overkill. After about a week I noticed some acne starting to appear, but I thought, well, this could be the purging stage and I am using a retinol, not a retinoid so my skin could be reacting differently. By the end of the second week, my skin had large cysts on areas of my face that I don't usually break out, but I kept with the routine, hoping that things would improve, knowing that it can take as long as twelve weeks to see any improvement.By the time I got to week six, my face was oily and fully broken out, not only with my usual hormonal acne, but cystic acne as well. It also seemed like my pores were more clogged than before (I have large, visible pores so I could see that something was different). I have had cystic acne previously as a teen on Prednisone and I already had experience with the amount of damage it can leave behind. As a couple of cysts came to the very surface and drained, I saw that my skin wasn't healing nicely --the cysts had left behind new icepick scars. I couldn't take it anymore--thank God I still wear a mask outside because I could not have covered what was happening with makeup. I noticed that I seemed to develop new acne during the night, so I decided to stop the retinol at night. After a couple of days the cystic acne seemed to stop coming up and after a week the oiliness lessened. But my pores were still very congested and I had still had more acne than I usually did. I have finally gone back to my old routine. I gave my skin a complete break for a week before starting the old routine again--just washed my face and used sunblock. No serums or acids of any kind. It's been a week into my old routine and my skin at least feels better, if not really looking it yet. I have kept on using the vitamin C and the hyaluronic acid in the mornings because my skin has gone back to being slightly dry and I don't think either serum is doing any harm. Not sure they are helping much though. My theory is that the retinol probably did start to help new skin cells to grow, but my older skin was not shedding at the rate it usually sheds, since I was not using my usual acids. I think that my pores got very congested rather quickly and because I am immunocompromised, infections may have started, possibly. Hence the cystic acne. The one thing I will say is that the fine lines that I had developing did decrease, so, there's that.At any rate these did not work for me overall and I would caution anyone who has a compromised immune system from using specifically the retinol. Hopefully my experience will be helpful to some of you.",1975,386,Beauty,4.4,,15,0.0

Mind you, I’m only a week and a half in but here is what I have so far:The products have very little scent so that’s nice. I got the four pack which includes niacinamide. This is to be used last. It’s very tacky, so my skin stays somewhere between oily and sticky all day after using it.Before using this I had a small area around my mouth and cheeks where my pores were looking larger than normal. Since using this for ten days it’s gotten much worse. I now have huge pores all over my face.I’ve also noticed a lot more redness throughout the day. My nose is always red, even with make up. But now it’s my entire face.I didn’t expect an overnight miracle when I ordered this but I definitely didn’t expect my skin to be getting worse while using it.Maybe this works differently for different skin types but my take on it is not very good.

2023-04-11,True,2,"I was very ecstatic to begin this new regiment for my skin, seeing all the positive feedback and being surprisingly cost effective too. HOWEVER I am greatly disappointed with the formulation and I have pharmacist background. Its possible they are expired or not mixed properly for consistency. After only a week of use I did notice some benefits to my skin, but the product dries up absurdly STICKY! Sooooo sticky that all my fly-away hairs get stuck to my face and hard to get them off, like as if I have wax on. And it looks shiny too LOL Its so sticky, forget about applying make up bc its like applying make up on top of sticky wax. Its awful to sleep in it too bc it gets all over my pillow and my hair etc. Also, its hard to get rid off the sticky residue even after long showers and exfoliating!! I dont know if I have a bad badge, expired stuff or just simply bad chemistry but I am greatly disappointed 😔 I was really excited to start this to feel better myself, have nicer skin on time for my birthday and blah blah.

Using 3 different kinds twice a day must've just been too much to handle.

I bought these same serums about 6 months ago (Bottle on the left) and it was perfect, no added fragrance or anything but when I bought again they had a new look to the bottles (Right) and as soon as I went to use it, I could tell there was added scent.

2023-03-23,True,2,"The retinol in this is very minimal. My skin reacts to even the smallest amounts of retinol in other OTC products when I first start to use them, and even in larger quantities, there was zero reaction to this serum, meaning there’s probably hardly any actual retinol in it. I hadn’t used retinol in months prior to this, so it’s not that my skin was just already adjusted to it. I used this for several months, so I gave it a fair chance.  I just started using another retinol product and it immediately started to shed the top layer of skin again. These serums feel nice, but they didn’t do much for my skin. I still broke out (probably more than usual) and my fine lines got no better. Perhaps it’s just not for my skin type.",1975,386,Beauty,4.4,,0,0.0029
2023-03-22,True,1,"For just over a year I have bought nine Tree Of Life products through Amazon, four of which were the hyaluronic acid serum, one of which (the first) was this set of three. This review focuses on the hyaluronic acid but applies to the set as well.I have found this product to be inconsistent nearly every time I’ve purchased it (which I’ve seen other reviews mention for many of their products). The most recent fourth bottle is extremely different compared to the ones prior. It is thicker, requires double the amount of product to cover my face and neck than before, it is tacky, does not spread well, and does not leave my skin smooth or hydrated in the least. There is a very distinct, and not great, difference. As for the retinol, I saw no difference and felt my face looked worse when I used it. As for the vitamin c, it was extremely drying, even just using a small amount once or twice per week and following with their lotion. I stopped using both the retinol and vitamin c halfway through the bottles. (Please see my later notes on water/aloe content and witch hazel in the hyaluronic acid serum as it applies to the other two products as well.)I contacted Tree Of Life with the above information, requesting a refund of the hyaluronic acid serum 2 oz bottle. The customer service representative informed me it was out of their return policy and would not give me a refund. I bought the product two months ago, but I only just opened it because I was finishing up the last bottle. This is terrible customer service. They showed no concern and offered no explanation for the product being so different and ineffective. I believe this speaks to the ethics of the company and how they do business. It also leads me to question their claims and ingredients as a whole. I have spent over $120 in the last year on nine of their products and have recommended it to two family members who also purchased. Now I’m embarrassed to have done so. Moving forward, I will spend my money elsewhere on better products and with companies who care about their customers and their experiences, not just turning a quick profit.Upon further inspection, the first ingredient for the hyaluronic acid serum is water and the fourth ingredient is Aloe. Aloe is comprised of 95% water. There may be plenty of other ingredients listed but with that much water content, we’re only getting a very tiny amount of each, at which point they’re just for show. As well, witch hazel is the second ingredient, which is well known in the skincare field for being too drying for mature skin, so it’s strange they opt to use such a large amount of it in so many of their products. Again, I suspect it’s a cheap way to fill their product. But that’s my fault for not paying closer attention. I hope you learn from my mistakes!Ultimately, there are far better options out there and many to choose from. I should have heeded my esthetician friend’s advice when she said, “You get what you pay for.” I had high hopes for this company due to the organic claims, using so many natural ingredients, and minimal plastic packaging. Unfortunately, I now see their true colors. I hope this was helpful in you making an informed decision.",2479,777,Beauty,4.4,,19,0.0
2023-06-29,True,1,"I bought this product with high hopes after reading the reviews of others… man, was I let down.I’ve never had problems with acne or breakouts. I wanted to add retinol to my skincare regimen because I’m getting older (38) and, although I’m not necessarily noticing any signs of aging since I’ve always followed a skincare routine, I wanted to add something to the areas where fine lines start to develop. I used these serums three times and had the worst breakout of my entire life. I seriously had more pimples at one time than I think I’ve ever had combined. My skin was red and irritated, I had these huge, white zits that were embarrassing and painful. It took almost two weeks of exfoliating and treating to get rid of the breakout. I was really disappointed because everyone speaks so highly of these serums. Everyone’s skin is different so I’m certainly not discrediting how it’s worked for others. In hindsight, I should have tried it out on a small part of my skin to see how it reacted before jumping all in.

I was using The Ordinary up until I dropped one of the bottles and noticed some acne scars/dark spots on my chin, which is when I decided it would be cheaper and faster just to get a full pack of everything— which I regret. I’ve struggled with acne and hormonal cysts since I was 13, Acutane helped for about a year but skincare was the main thing keeping it under control. Please don’t buy this.

I had not had a single pimple in over 7 years, more than one pimple/zit at the same time in over 20 years until using these. I’m very disappointed.",2479,777,Beauty,4.4,,5,0.0126
2019-06-20,True,1,"Previous to trying these serums, I was using dermatologist/doctor prescribed Retin-A creams and saw significant differences/skin improvements within the first 2 weeks. However due to the increased costs of the prescription cream, I searched for a cheaper alternative and found this. I thought this full face regimen would be a complete life-changing and skin-altering experience but sadly, that's not the case and my poor skin is now suffering the consequences. My skin went from being very hydrated and smooth with some minor acne scarring from hormonal acne to full dehydrated, scaly, and irritated skin. The worst part is that these serums are not safe for people with acne prone and oily skin. All of these serums contain jojoba oil, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Oil, and/or emulsifiers that trigger fungal acne which is what I am now battling due to these serums. I have used these products for only a month and they have completely destroyed my skin. My routine for the month was using the Vitamin C Serum in the morning and the Hyaluronic Acid and Retinol Serum at night. I felt that the Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid Serums barely hydrated my skin and left it feeling tight or rough. Honestly, my Thayers Rose Petal toner that I have been using for years did a better job making my skin plump and smooth. Additionally, the Retinol Serum did not have any impact on my skin probably due to the relatively low concentration. It did not help make it more smooth, soft, and especially did not help diminish my acne scars, spots, and slight skin discoloration. Definitely the worse serums I have ever used, highly do not recommend! Last note, be careful combining so many different products with fungal acne triggers (especially if you are in hot and humid areas). Disclaimer: this may only be an issue for you if you have sensitive and naturally oily skin that is prone to overproducing sebum. If you don't have these issues, you may not react the same way I did.

2020-05-07,True,1,"While I'm glad these serums work for many, I would strongly caution people with oily skin to avoid them. As another reviewer said, they are highly comedogenic. I wish I had seen that particular review before I purchased. I recently turned 60 and thought I should start using something on the fine lines and sun spots on my face. I've only used moisturizer sporadically in the past because of my oily skin although I've been using a BB cream as foundation for a few years. I didn't want to spend a ton of money on a product consisting of a bunch of chemicals with a high-end name attached to it so thought this was the perfect solution. While I saw some very slight improvement in the fine lines and brown spots, I also started having horrific breakouts. At 60!!!! Blister-like cystic acne and blackheads and whiteheads galore! It was confusing and embarrassing! I thought it was because of the retinol so was willing to give it a chance and experimented with using the different serums at different times of day, etc. Nothing changed. I then thought maybe the problem was due to an underlying, undiagnosed health issue but evidently not because when the bottle of retinol ran out I decided to try a different product (a cream, not a serum) that I found here on Amazon, similarly priced. The acne cleared up immediately even though the cream has even more retinol than this serum. I don't want to give the name of the cream here because it may not be good for everyone. I'm just saying, ladies, don't give up the search. The right product for you is out there.

2022-03-09,True,3,"I've been using these consistently for 7 days now after I asked my friend what her skincare routine was from noticing how clear her skin has been looking lately. She recommended this product.My skin type: SUPER OILY with occasional dry patches on my chin and nose, even if my whole face is glistening it's so oily.My prior skincare routine: I'm in my 30s(F) and had a basic routine that I've learned is not that great. Washed my face nightly with the Cetaphil daily facial cleanser and would use Cetaphil body lotion for my face too. In the mornings I'd just rinse my face in the shower; no cleanser. I don't wear sunscreen on my face, though I should probably start.Routine since purchasing these serums: Mornings - still just rinsing my face with water only, then 4 drops of vitamin C, then 3 drops of the hyaluronic. Nights - still washing with the Cetaphil, then toner (Biore toner with witch hazel because it had good reviews), then 3 drops of retinol, then 3 drops of hyaluronic, then started using PM Cerave facial moisturizer that also has hyaluronic acid in it. *I used all the serums around my eyes too, including my eyelids... probably not great that I do that but I just make sure I don't get the stuff in my eyes. *I also wait a couple of minutes in between each step. *The order and time of day I use the serums was the suggested order from the seller... except I totally spaced on using retinol only a few times a week and used it every night.Results after one week in: Overall my skin tone appears to be more even though it's not that noticeable. I get acne occasionally and this has helped it (though not a miracle), but that's the biggest win for me so far. I personally feel like this new routine is exhausting but I'm going to stick to it. As for the details: my forehead, nose, area in the inner corners of my eyelids, and chin started to get dry and peel a bit... maybe because I've never used any of these before and was applying the retinol every night. My skin didn't feel irritated though. I also noticed at the end of the second day of this new routine that the pores on my cheeks were HUGE... it was a new and alarming experience for me. They were clogged with gross hard gunk and I used a facial tool that looks like a metal loop to declog them. It didn't happen again after that so I'm wondering if the new routine just shocked my skin. I've also noticed that my face has gotten even more oily. On my zoom calls the light from my laptop is reflecting off my glistening oil-slicked skin by late morning. I'm using oil blotting sheets a few times a day now.I'll update again after a month.UPDATE 5/13/22: Decided to give it two months and have kept the same daily routine consistently ever since the first review. The oiliness of my skin hasn’t subsided. The weird clogged pores that I experienced soon after I started using these have though. The clearness of my skin has only marginally improved and I still got acne last month. By no means did I personally experience any significant improvement in my skin tone, smoothness, firmness, or clearness. No one has commented on my skin looking any different either. I’ll still finish out the bottles. Maybe it takes more than two months to see visible results, who knows. If I see any other changes I’ll add another update.FINAL UPDATE 7/18/22: Welp! No changes since the last update even though I’ve almost finished the bottles. Maybe it was just my skin, who knows.

And they do have the exact same ingredients, so which one does what, if anything.  Someone did mention that in one of their reviews.  Since I didn't really know what it should look like, I just kept using it.  Well, it's been about 3-4 weeks of using it faithfully every day, and there is some difference.  I'm sure it's a combination of using the Neutrogena Hydro Boost cleansing gel, the CeraVe renewing cleanser as well as the Vitamin E, Retinol and Hyaluronic Acid which is making a difference.  The puffiness under my eyes is not as prominent as it once was.  I'm just not sure if it's working or not, especially since 2 of them have the same ingredients.

Clearly this company has very poor packaging/label issues and is not allergy friendly. 3 stars will not buy again.,5708,579,Beauty,4.4,,0,0.0013
2023-07-31,True,5,"I have been so impressed with this product.  I honestly felt like I could see a difference after day 1.  These pictures were taken 12 days apart.  The picture on the left was taken 1 week after using this product twice a day as indicated in the directions.  I also included using a .5mm microderm abrader roller twice a week. I admit that the picture on the right was taken after a long week of camping in the hot, desert sun, so I had a lot more sun exposure than I normally would get, but at the very least I feel that this product helped heal my damaged skin.  I've also noticed my skin feels moist and has a nice glow since using this.  I am just at that age when wrinkles and fine lines are starting to show up in my forehead and corners of my eyes, and I'll try and update this review when I've been using this long enough to make a difference there.  Regardless I am pleasantly surprised with the results and intend on continued use as part of my skincare regimen.  You really can't beat the price!!!",47383,9206,Beauty,4.4,,6,0.0005

2020-08-08,True,5,"Okay - I do not leave reviews unless I honestly love a product/products, and I know it can be hard to know (on Amazon) these days who’s a REAL customer & who isn’t. I’m real, folks! I paid full price and received nothing for free, so please hear what I’m saying about these products. We are in the fight for beautiful, younger, fresher skin together! I bought these 3 serums and have used them for the past week (since receiving my shipment quickly...within 24 hrs) and WOW! When my husband said,”Oh my God! No joke babe, your skin looks younger - YOU look younger...” and he was right! Usually would take weeks to see a difference, but let me tell you, this was immediate.I also purchased a derma roller to use with the serums a few days a week. I’ll explain below!I’m about to turn 43 years old & my skin has/had become “ruddy”, red, splotchy, uneven texture, some hyper-pigmentation (i.e. age spots) with dry patches and then a super-oily t-zone - ahhhhhh!! Then, there are the lovely fine lines & wrinkles that were developing around my mouth, forehead, and between brows as well. If you’re over 40, you know what I’m saying..Okay, so I also bought a derma roller to use as well.I also use Zinc bar soap for my daily face wash - and I had been out of my Zinc soap for a couple of months, which is no bueno for my skin. Zinc soap is great for redness, rosacea, flakiness around nose and eyebrows (which you may think is dry skin, but it’s actually flakes produced from excessive oil in those areas....so it helps that PLUS helps with my redness in other areas on my face, AND doesn’t dry my skin out...so I highly recommend a Zinc soap if any of you gals are dealing with what looks like dry flakes in/around eyebrows and nose! Get the Zinc soap! It’s about $8-$10 on Amazon).So, in the a.m., day #1, washed with Zinc Soap, rinsed with warm water (not hot), then got my derma roller out (it has tiny little needles on it, so NOT the jade roller, but a derma roller- WITH needles), washed it with rubbing alcohol first to sterilize, then held my skin taught and rolled up & down my face vertically (whole face...lips too - and make a face to stretch your lips taught, otherwise it won’t work on the lips 👄), then went back over my entire face horizontally (I watched several videos on how to safely use the derma roller, so please watch some videos so that you don’t overdo it), my face was a little red, but it did not hurt at all. It creates tiny little “holes” (or little “traumas” if you will) that your body will send collagen to fix, thus  forcing collagen into those areas to repair and rejuvenate- GENIUS! So, THEN you go and put those 3 serums on right over the freshly derma rolled skin, and BOOM! My skin LITERALLY plumped up before my eyes! I put vitamin C on first, then use the cool setting on my blowdryer to blow it dry a bit, then I do the retinol serum, then cool dry a bit to allow it to absorb, then I put the last serum on after that and let it sink in.That evening I washed my face with Zinc soap before bed and then use Tree Of Life Moisturizer Cream with retinol and hyarulonic acid afterward and sleep with that stuff on.A little goes a long way with Tree of Life serums and mousturizers too, so don’t feel like you have to slather it on. You don’t! I put my makeup on right over the top of the serums (I wait about 30 min before applying makeup, just to allow the serums to soak in.I allow 1 to 2 days between derma rolling, and just do my zinc soap for face wash and then I apply the serums as usual, without the derma roller on the “in-between-derma-rolling-days”.My fine lines are definitely less noticeable and the places with hyper pigmentation have faded out quite a bit (not entirely- but dude, it’s been literally like 6 days...so IMAGINE what my skin will look like in a month?!). Also, my skin texture is absolutely smoother and the color is SO much more even already.Let me be clear though, my skin is totally red after I apply the serums...and then it calms. It doesn’t hurt whatsoever, but initially I am red right after applying. Especially after derma rolling and applying - expect immediate redness and then it will go away.I’ve used a lot of serums, and these 3 are the best I’ve found! Purchase them! Be diligent and apply daily - there is NO WAY that you aren’t going to see improvement in your skin! Younger, softer, smoother skin is here. Awesome job, Tree of Life!",47383,9206,Beauty,4.4,,607,0.0
2019-08-01,True,2,"I read a number of 1-2 star reviews and was concerned a out faul smelling watered down product. Mine came new and sealed, triple packaged. No faul smell, but hyaluronic acid smells like rose which is probably due to ethylhexyglycerin that is used as a preservative for that compound.  I am sensitive to smells and not sure that serum can work out for me. I wish they found something neutral to preserve that serum.3 stars so far as I can't tell much until i get to use the system for a while. Will update when i have results.Update: I don't see any change in appearance of my skin. The product stays on top of the skin ad a residue making my face feel greasy. Also, my skin is always clear, but I've noticed it try to break out in a couple of spots. Considering that almost never happens to me, it might be not ideal for people who already have skin prone to issues.

All 3 products leave my skin feeling sticky with or without my moisturizer.  Adding my makeup routine, it doesn’t blend at all with my makeup and gives my skin a clumpy, even more oily look.  To top it off, I’ve noticed zero difference in any blemishes, redness, dark spots, etc.  like some other reviewers it’s also caused me to breakout and have bumpy skin.  I’ve used other serums before and have never experienced any of these problems.

2022-03-11,True,3,"Just got the trio yesterday. Tried it on my hands to check for reactions, all was good. The vit c was a little “greasy shiny” the retinol was drying as retinol will be. Used the hyaluronic acid on top of them, definitely still need a little moisturizer or maybe jojoba oil on top. The vit c was thick textured the retinol was a little thick and the hyaluronic was thin. Tried the vit c with hyaluronic acid on my face and still think the vit c is a little greasy. No real complaints yet since I just got it but definitely did not have ten min results or even great morning results, did not see any difference this morning. Will continue to use and update this later. UPDATE: couple days in, I use the retinol at night and maybe wake up with slightly fuller wrinkles. No miracle cure yet. But am thinking it’s better than the cerave vit c and retinol serums at not causing acne. I was using the cerave for a couple weeks before getting this and had random odd pimples everywhere. This stuff might be calming them down. UPDATE UPDATE: two weeks in, no difference in wrinkles or firming of the skin or making my pores look any better. No change other than my skin may be a little more even toned. Acne scars and dark spots are no better yet but redness is better. Acne is good with this stuff.

2021-07-08,True,3,"I've been using all three of these for about 10-11 weeks daily, and I have not yet seen any dramatic results. I am a bit envious of the women who have amazing results after only two weeks of use. I obviously liked them enough to purchase a second time, and will see how my skin responds over the next month. I use the Vit C Serum and Hyaluronic Acid Serum in the daytime, and the Retinol at night, sometimes also with a bit of the Hyalluronic Acid at night.I was puzzled why women were alerted to ""only use the Retinol once a week at first, to not get the Retinol redness!"" because from the start I used it about every few days, and not once had any redness or dryness from it. My skin seems more hydrated - I use no other moisturizer other than these - but it is summer, not winter, and my facial skin does not get very dry in summer.Maybe I am not seeing dramatic results because my skin was not too bad to start with. I am 60 years old, I try to keep my face out of the sun, I am vegan, and eat lots of veggies and take vitamins, so maybe I have ""pretty good"" skin and don't realize it. I was hoping to see a smoothing out of the wrinkles aorund my mouth, chin, and edge of my eyes, but so far see no real change there, sadly. But I will keep trying!

2021-04-28,True,3,"Okay. I’ll try to keep short... I started my skin care journey about 5 months ago. Here I started incorporating TruSkin vitamin C serum (most popular amazon brand) twice a day. Had great results with it and LOVE how quickly it absorbs with no residue feeling. However, about a month ago my routine has just seemed less effective. Probably just need a switch up as my skin has become accustomed.When it was time to buy another bottle of vitamin C. I didn’t feel like dropping $20 when I wasn’t sure if it was really working anymore, so I purchased the cheap Eclat brand (other popular amazon choice at $7 a bottle). Absolutely hated it, didn’t absorb well and went to go buy another TruSkin bottle.However, I have been wanting to incorporate a retinol serum and tree of life is also highly rated. So I decided to buy this three pack instead hoping I would like this vitamin C serum more than the last. Unfortunately, I am not a huge fan. Both the retinol and vitamin C serum stay really tacky on the skin. Face just feels sticky, even after allowing 45+ minutes for it to dry before applying moisturizer. It hasn’t been long enough to comment on the effectiveness, but I won’t be able to continue with the C serum & already repurchased the TruSkin brand. I’ll reluctantly continue with the retinol, but will look for another brand once I finish the bottle.TL;DR: It might be effective (can’t comment), but the serum doesn't absorb well and feels thick on the face well after application. Not ideal for oily skin and increases shine. Better options out there.",5708,579,Beauty,4.4,,6,0.0

It’s been three months and I still don’t like the consistency plus I don’t see any difference on my skin.Not complaining of my skin, it’s healthy and beautiful but just wanted for maintenance. I’m 36 years old, no fillers and barely started using external products this year as I have no wrinkles yet but want to prevent the formation of them. (People think I’m 27, I attribute my healthy skin to monthly facials since the age of 16) and although I just started using products and haven’t tried many brands, I would not purchase this one again.

2022-05-12,True,3,"So happy to have found this product. Only concern is the hyaluronic acid containing wood chisel. Which hazel is very drying while hyaluronic acid is meant to act as a moisture barrier / humectant to keep moisture in so I find it counterintuitive. But I'll also have combo skin that has been on the more oily side the older I've gotten, I'm 31. So I am hoping that within the next two weeks my skin will acclimate to it and it will work well for me. The smell isn't overpowering and it is a great three step system to start a great base routine before you get into all the fancy other products. I know I could look at it on Google but with people's personal testimonies I wish that the site would put what order to put these products on because I know certain acids before and after vitamin C can damage your skin. Overall great product just need a little bit more directions instead of the basics on the back telling you to add moisturizer afterwards.

2021-12-08,True,3,"I tried Tree’s anti aging products for about 6 months.  I did notice a slight difference the first few times I used it.  My face looked a little bit brighter.  However, after the initial use I stopped seeing any real results and after 6 months my skin did not look like I was doing anything as far as wrinkles, singh skin, dullness.  I think with these products I aged every bit as fast as though I had not used anything at all.  I recently started using Ordinary antiaging products and I have had dramatic results!  I just started using them about a month or two ago and I am amazed at how my skin looks after just a short time.  Wrinkle and fine lines are visibly much lighter, my skin is visibly tighter and brighter.  Ordinary is very inexpensive as well making their products very difficult to beat.  If you are looking for serious anti aging serums I recommend that you try Ordinary and don’t waste your money on these products.  If your just looking for something to help prevent visible signs of aging  you might get some results with Tree but if you want serious dramatic change you won’t find that here.",5708,579,Beauty,4.4,,0,0.0005

Wasn’t sure on sizing because my kid is transitioning from little to big kid sizing; got the smallest sizing thinking they might fit like a 6/7 but they’re more like a 7/8.

Not as thick as a regular sweatshirt but with the windproof exterior should be warmer.  She loves it even though it runs large on her.

2023-05-07,False,4,"At the value price of $58.99 USD (currently $48.99 USD using the online $10 USD coupon), this a good casual use 10-inch tablet. It is a generic “designed and assembled in China” Android 11 device with no name brand on the excellent box or on the instructions. It comes with a 37 inch plus USB C charging cord, a very basic instructions pamphlet, and a protective screen you can attach if you wish. The battery was at 34% upon arrival, and it took a bit less than 1 hour 50 minutes to charge to 100%. It successfully initiated on the second attempt, indicating it could not connect on the first try (while the Internet was good). Initially the auto-rotate feature did not work, but worked better after I turned the feature off and on again. Auto rotate cannot be used in some cases, for example, if you use the Google search bar on the home screen, results will only be available in portrait mode, however if you open Google and do a search auto-rotate works fine. This tablet accepts a micro-SD card to expand memory (no indication of the capacity is listed) and a SIM card (no further information is provide, but this may mean it can be used a cell phone?). The speakers provide pretty good sound and the screen resolution fine at 1280 x 800 (but not great). It has both forward and rear facing cameras, but no details are available. I mostly surfed the Web with this tablet and initially it was a bit “laggy”, but seemed to improve with use. The tablet warned me when the battery reached 15% after 4 hours 30 minutes, and noted it would take 2 hours to fully recharge to 100%. The power button protrudes a bit more than I am used to with my other tablets, and I inadvertently powered on the tablet quite a few times. Like all the tablets I have used, this tablet is not tactile, and you will need to take care in handling it (I asked the seller if a case is available and am awaiting a reply). Download speeds are passable on this tablet averaging about 30Mbps in a number of online speed tests. We have 800Mbps service (which I do get on my laptop), and just for a point of reference (as it is not fair to compare this tablet to more expensive devices), both of my Fire 10-inch tablets (current and previous generations) averaged 8 to 9 times faster download speeds using the same speed tests and conditions. For the price and the how I used this tablet (casual Web surfing), the slower download speeds are acceptable to me. Bottom line is this could be a good choice for many as an affordable, casual use tablet. For me this is a 3.5-star item at the price and use I indicated, which I have rounded to 4 stars.",35,25,Laptops and Tablets,3.8,,5,0.0003
2023-05-09,False,4,"While this is much less expensive than name brand tablets, there are a number of ""no name"" chinese tablets that are near this price  (currently $49).  So I'm comparing this tablet to similar  tablets, not the name brand tablets.  Within this group, given the features, the cost of this tablet is on the low side, which is good.Everything I tested worked. Screen, WIFI, bluetooth, on screen keyboard, charging, usb connection to a PC, cameras (front and back, still and movie mode), etc.Of the 3GB RAM, 1.3 GB was available to run more apps, after loading the basic OS, which was reasonable  (some tablets only have 2GB and that would not leave much room to run other apps).  7.5GB of storage was used, leaving 57GB for pictures, movies, other user data.  That is more than enough for my needs.The performance was way below average, but that is to be expected for a tablet so cheap.  For example, screen resolution was low, colors muted, screen response was slow,  even WIFI performance was about 1/3 what I was getting on an old phone.  Scrolling through web pages was a little ""jerky"", probably due to lack of screen processing power and/or WIFI performance.  Speakers are not great (but using headphone jack or bluetooth to an external speakers or headset works fine).The description says it will last up to 8 hours watching videos, but ""up to"" is a marketing weasel word here.  In my testing, I got about 4 hours of mixed usage, including watching a movie (from a file on the machine), watching youtube, reading news on Google chrome, playing with the calculator, etc.So this would be a great machine for a young child, if they ruin it, at least the financial damage is low.  For an adult, their needs would need to be limited.  I would not recommend it as a general purpose machine for an adult unless cost is really important and you have patience  (and no good tablets nearby to compare it to).",35,25,Laptops and Tablets,3.8,,6,0.0002

The colors could be richer, but they did improve when I switched out the screen protector. It comes with some memory and an expansion slot, so that's great for downloading movies or books.Processing-wise, I noticed a little lag when using some apps. Nothing inhibiting, but probably not great for apps that need quick responses like gaming. My kids tried Roblox on it, and it depended on the game as to how it performed (most were okay though).The sound isn't that bad. Like any phone or tablet. I like it better with headphones, but the volume without is still decently loud.I highly recommend having a screen protector order on standby. The one that comes with it was flismy, cloudy, and basically made of bubbles. It also started peeling up within a few days of pretty limited use (I included some pictures to show how it looked).

All the office productivity apps I tried installed fine. I did get crashes from such apps about every 10th use (docking a star for that), but the tablet was fine for reading documents and checking email. There are delays where you have to wait while apps open or think in the background, but I can handle that and expect it for the price (not removing any stars for that).My goal for this was mainly to be able to open google docs and read PDFs and this tablet handles this work case just fine, even for very large PDFs (see my photos). The screen is clear and readable, but again it's not as high resolution as an iPad - and I wouldn't expect it for the price. Within that framework this tablet was a success for me - I can sit and review PDFs or check emails on a larger screen than my phone. Given the low price point, I'll take it as a win!

Setup was easy (as most Android systems are) and after about 15-20 minutes I was able to make use of this tablet.Screen quality is reasonably good. Video playback was kind of meh until I set it to a higher resolution. The sound quality is where this unit suffers. However, tablet, small speakers, etcs. The *placement* however...erg.Most people are right handed, and when holding this sideways, the speakers are facing DOWN. Directly into your lap, stand, or whatever you might be using as a support. This also results in a varity of things getting up into the openings if you aren't careful.Battery life is also a concern, as just leaving this on standby (not being used) resulted in a 3-4 day battery life. Heavy use is going to kill the battery quickly.The packaging was good (albeit very bland) and the addition of a screen protector is a nice touch overall.It's not a bad unit, but there are things that just don't make it great.

I was able to transfer the apps from my current tablet to my new tablet. This tablet is much slower, but it works well. The icons are different than my other tablet and my computer - similar but different so it took a minute to be able to figure it out - the back arrow is on the left side instead of the right, the circle in the middle is close to the same, and the multi-screen that are 3 lines on my tablet are represented by a box. Once you get used to it, it works about the same! The biggest complaint I have is that it was really hard to figure out a case that would work. The product dimensions are listed as 7.2 x 4.9 x .25 inches. ACTUAL measurements are 9.5 x 6.5 x .25 inches.  It seems to turn off rather quickly too. I constantly have to push the button to turn it back on - there might be something in settings that I can change for it to turn off - I found the battery saver but it was turned off.

If you want something your kids can use and abuse, or to bring a tablet onto a trip to watch videos and read books, but don't want to worry if it gets lost/stolen, this is what you want.It's about the size of a standard mid-size iPad, although you can immediately get a sense of the plastic-y feel of the device the moment you touch it.

On the flip side, the cheaper materials make it more lightweight than some others its size.In terms of performance, which is mainly what my rating is based on, it's fully middling. It functions and will open up most Android apps, albeit you're going to run into issues if you ever want to use a larger or more resource-intensive app. The Octo-Core processor is really starting to show its age, and so you'll often find it slowing down randomly, and I even had a few times where the whole thing froze for a few seconds when switching between apps. You definitely don't want anything running in the background. It's definitely passable, but if performance is important, you could do better for $10 or $20 more.Overall, if you need a tablet you don't need to run intense apps on and can stand a crack or two, this is a perfect one to use. Otherwise, you'll want to get something a little bit higher-end.",18,9,Laptops and Tablets,3.8,,0,0.0008

While I don't need something high performance for this use, just tapping links on a web page and other tasks is just not very responsive at all, making for a frustrating experience. Also the time it takes to update, install, and load apps is also frustratingly slow.

It has both front and rear camera, a slot for additional memory, two stereo speakers, rocker volume control, an on/off switch, and a USB C port for power and connectivity.  Also included is a USB C cable and a transparent film screen protector and a brief instruction booklet.  It runs vanilla Android version 11 which give you access to all your favorite Google apps and the Google Play store for more apps, eBooks, games etc.I've used the 10 inch tablet for a few hours at this point and can say the screen colors and resolution are very good, and the overall response time for most operations is also snappy.  For the listed price of $59, this is certainly a good option over Amazon tablets that lock you into their exclusive ecosystem.  IT much more reasonably priced than similar sized Samsung tablets, and while perhaps not offering quite that level of performance and quality, it certainly is good enough for general use and a good choice for children as well as adults who won't be using it for intensive applications, but want something for email and games.",60,26,Laptops and Tablets,3.8,,1,0.0101

Fortunately, REALLY good ones can be had on Amazon for cheap: https://amzn.to/42LKknYIt isn't the most powerful Android tablet, but it isn't exactly weak (as so many cheap tablets are wont to be).  It runs well enough, as long as you keep your expectations tempered.  The touch screen was surprisingly responsive for such a cheap tablet, although the screen's colors are a little dull and muted.  The cover is only plastic and I suspect that it will scratch easily.  That's what you get for this price range.  Just be careful with it and it will be fine.My favorite part is what it DOESN'T include: bloat.  There is no sign of the usual OEM trash that is baked into stock Android images and can't be removed.  Yes, the typical Google services are there, but nothing more than a few little apps that you may or may not ever use.  For fun, I connected it to the screen/keyboard combo that I use with my Samsung phone (https://amzn.to/42s4tQc).

My wife had a belly laugh when I told her that I was using these sock for UI.

2023-07-05,False,4,"This is my first remote control car, so I'm very much a beginner. The car moves really fast at full speed, and the steering is very sensitive which makes it hard for a beginner like me to control easily. However, after trying it a few minutes a day over several days, I'm slowly getting the hang of it. I started by experimenting with it indoors, but there's just not enough room to maneuver when getting use to the controls. I recommend taking it outside to get some experience with it in a larger area. It's more fun when it has more room to roam.My son and grandkids came for a visit, and they were happy to do some testing of this RC car. My 8 year old granddaughter had a blast with it. She didn't get to the point of consistent control, but some of the dramatic crashes were part of the fun (the bumpers were helpful to soften some crashes). My 4 year old granddaughter mostly just crashed it, that is, she basically had no control of it. My two year old grandson was happily pedal to the medal with no attempt at steering it till the car hit the first tree or other object at full speed ahead. The kids liked the lights on the car. My 40 year old engineer son thought it was great fun but feels the steering is too sensitive and the car bounces around too much when it hits small debris at top speed, sometimes causing loss of control.The Amazon product page says age ""8 years and up"" but the instructions say ""not suitable for children younger than 14 years old."" That's a bit ambiguous, but I'd say it's okay for an 8 year old but expect some cosmetic damage or worse due to frequent crashes (the kids broke part of the air foil, see photo with a few days of ""mileage"" on it). A 14 year old would hopefully be more responsible.The car works well on pavement but even works off-road until getting into deeper grass, leaves, or other debris.I've noticed that the controller occasionally loses connection with the car requiring having to reset the car (turn off and on) and/or the controller, but that was infrequent, maybe twice with one battery charge.A screw driver is included for removing the batteries in the car and controller and installing the air foil. The spare battery with charging cable is a nice bonus, but it takes a couple minutes minimum to remove the screw on the battery panel, then disconnect and reconnect the battery. An updated design for a quick battery swap would be a welcome improvement. One battery lasted about 25 minutes with mostly continuous use by my grandkids. Recharge is 2 to 3 hours according to the instructions.

I mean it works, but it does take away some element of the game. The claw action itself is decent enough, and the light and sounds complete the package. The plastic body has some scratches/scrapes when we got it, my wife even wondered if it was used, I didn't think so but it certainly could have been better finished. It is nice that it's dual powered, either with batteries or with USB, I used an older battery bank and it's perfect, no need to constantly replace the batteries while the battery bank provides plenty of power.I think due to the limited range of motion this likely will not entice the older kids, maybe up to 5 or 6 years old.

The right joystick controls up and down, and the claw opens and closes automatically based on position. So you rotate to a toy, lower the claw, then rotate to the chute. It’s okay, but I didn’t think it was that much fun when I tried it. On the plus side, the claw does grip and doesn’t drop the toy. The claw machine runs off 5 AA batteries or USB-C power.",4,4,Toys,3.6,,0,0.3794

It is just a weird handle, meaning that this gun leaves your child tethered to a incredibly cheap and shallow tray, and leaves you refilling it over and over and over and over.Additionally, the battery life is poor.  15 to 20 minutes per charge tops. I figured that if they were going to bother putting a rechargeable battery in it, it would at least blow bubbles for an hour. Even worse is that there is not even an option to install traditional batteries to help combat the issue with the rechargeable battery.If I had anything nice to say about the gun, it is that it is attractively designed for kids who love trucks.

I wanted to compare and see which type worked better.  (If the solution was attached and then leaked, I would rather just have the dip tray.)  The other ones with drip trays I've seen all show the tray in the pictures and are clear about it.  This one doesn't show a tray, doesn't mention a tray (unless that is what they mean by ""Bearing groove""), and has a gray plastic cylinder that's pretty much exactly the size of the bubble bottle, which gives the impression that the bottle would attach.  Nope.  This one has a tray for dipping too.  And it is a super flimsy one at that.  In fact pretty much every aspect of this bubble gun is a step down from the other one I have, including the bubble output.  I think the gray cylinder in the front is supposed to make it seem like a machine gun, which also makes little sense since the gun is supposed to look like a truck / bulldozer.

It also has a ""spy"" feature.  Send the robot to a location, enable spy mode, and it will ""listen"" to whatever conversation is going on and transmit it back to the remote.

2023-07-31,True,5,"First of all, it's a fun toy.  The kids are giggling and chasing each other with it as I write this.  Since it's been a few hours, and they're already deciding who gets to keep it in their room overnight, I'd say it's a success.As you can see in the video, the remote control is extremely responsive, it spins and turns and moves much faster than you'd expect!  I didn't have a speedometer, but let's say maybe 6-8ft/second?  It can really shift.  Luckily, the remote's range keeps up with it.  I ran it from one end of the house to the other, with partitions and walls in the way, and it did fine - 25 to 30 feet away.The kids went bonkers over the walkie-talkie features : press the side button and speak into the controller and your voice comes out from the robot.  Press the ""spy"" button (that looks like a phone) and the robot works like a microphone, sending sound back to the controller.Of course, turning off all the lights, having it's little glowing eyes as it rolls into the room, making it spin, and then having it charge at a kid while saying ""I'm gonna GET YOU!"" though the walkie talkie is apparently the new best thing in my house.As far as other advertised features : it also has a program button which lets you record moves and play them back, and can play 3 little songs.  Additionally, it has poseable little hands - I put a pencil in one just to take a picture.  I suppose it could joust, but we'll probably want something less pointed before the kids get any ideas.Last, the robot comes with 6 triple-A batteries, 3 each for the robot and the controller, plus a little screwdriver you'll need to open the battery compartments.  As per standard in my household, the screwdriver was almost immediately lost, but it did turn up again later.",70,68,Toys,4.8,,1,0.0

2018-03-20,True,5,"This is not only a wonderful use of the real life public figure ""Marlon Bundo"" the Pence family's beloved pet rabbit, it is also a very good book! I don't mean that it's a good book just because it opposes Mike Pence and his bigoted views towards the LGBTQ community and diversity in general, I mean it's actually, and truly a very very good book. This whimsical tale is a wonderfully cute and fun read that promotes the values of friendship, the value of choice, and that it's OK to be different.(Also, despite what some delusional haters seem to be claiming, this book does NOT mention, specify or even elude to anything that is actually or even remotely or vaguely explicitly sexual in nature whatsoever. There is not one single mention of sex or anything pertaining to it to be found. As a child, we know that people fall in love and get married long before we know what they do in bed afterwards. In this vein of thought, Cinderella is just as guilty of whatever these people are accusing this story by Marlon Bundo of doing.)Anyways, we bought the Kindle Version and we also have a hard copy on the way. I've already read the book aloud to my children as well as my entire family (twice) and they all thoroughly enjoyed the experience, even the pets.After the first reading, one of my children actually said to me ""That's beautiful"" and I agreed. They then went on to tell me that it was also ""almost"" as beautiful as the fact that this book about the official Bunny of the Vice President of the United States of America ""Marlon Bundo"" depicts said bunny as being gay and wanting to marry a gay brown bunny, would surely annoy the Vice President and his family quite a lot, and that it's very obviously that they deserve to be annoyed by this book because they are so hateful towards gay people and and non whites. The saying really is true, kids say the darnedest things... They also know FAR more about what is going on than most adults give them credit for.So... This is the point in my initial review (this is my second attempt) that I referred to the great charities that this book is supporting as I was actually one of the first people to review this book as soon as it was released but I unwittingly broke the rules by posting external links to the charities that the proceeds from the sale of this book will be funding. So now I know... adding a link to a charity group (or anything else for that matter) will result in your review going into a sort of ""limbo"" state for a great deal of time, during which you cannot edit, delete or write a new review. So... for future reference, the 3 or 4 or other people reading this that may wish to add links to a review in the future and did not know it was against the rules, will now know that it will get your review declined.Either way, the charities that this book are supporting are far more specialized than ""art therapy"" which is what the Pence family chose to promote with their Lesser Bundo Book. In fact, I'm quite certain that ""art therapy"" is not even covered on my health insurance plan... Is it covered on yours? Perhaps it could help a person paint away the gay? Engage in a little scribbling and then erase the AIDS? I'm certain that art can quite seriously be a great form of therapy for some people, but does it truly need to be administered by a professional in order to achieve the desired results? I guess I will likely never know, as it is not covered on my insurance anyways...In contrast, the TREVOR Project and AIDS UNITED, the charities benefiting from the sale of THIS book, are devoted to helping other less fortunate bunnies that are also different like Marlon Bundo and/or may be fighting off something that is very terrifying and deadly. Artistry in this case, is of course, optional.To sum it all up, I highly recommend this book to ANYONE that can read or be read to regardless of age or species.",15808,9093,Children Books,4.9,4.6,475,0.00025
2019-05-23,True,5,"I suspect that if America eventually forgets everything else about ""Last Week Tonight"" (and I'd rue any day when that came to pass), John Oliver will have made his distinctive mark on pop culture with this innovation. So, even with all of their financial proceeds going to support AIDS United and the Trevor Project, this is a shrewd branding and publicity move from Oliver and Co. Not that there's anything wrong with a good show cementing its image and getting positive attention while spreading a worthy message!The cleverest part is that this book definitely qualifies as political satire, yet it is performed at a level--and with an underlying message--that works very well for children. I haven't come across many books that have been both so clearly ( to grown-ups) satirical and so child-friendly. Hence my referring to the book as innovative: while there are certainly kids' books, movies, or TV shows that also work on an adult level, I've yet to see one as overtly topical or as directly, unflinchingly focused on contentious and crucial concerns as Oliver's ""Bundo"".I'd just ask those who so vehemently disagree with the content of this book, firstly, to carefully reconsider calls for any writings or speech whose contents you may disagree with to be removed. Suppression of speech is rarely (if ever) a constructive problem solver, and any move to set a such a precedent cuts against the agency of a free and open society in which we can talk about things to learn from each other to continue developing our thinking. Secondly, would those who so clearly assert the right to determine what is appropriate for their own children please think of extending that choice to other families? Maybe you don't feel this book is suitable for your child, but other families feel just as strongly that this book can provide something of great value to their children, and they have just as much of a right (and a duty) to teach their children in the best ways they know how as do you.I can see the message of Oliver's ""Bundo"", despite or maybe even because of its specificity, resonating with both kids and adults long after our present leaders are washed away through history. This book may just be perfect for any young child who needs to know that love matters, and that their feelings are not only acceptable but are worthy of being embraced, honored, and protected by any society that fully values the well-being of all its members. And if Marlon and Wesley happen to amuse adult readers for other reasons while imparting this bit of truth, that's just a sublime  bonus to nurturing a child's sense of self worth and compassion for others.",15808,9093,Children Books,4.9,4.6,12,0.0001

Well, he is almost 6, and he LOVES this story.  The concept of love and acceptance is an easy one for young ones to understand, IF you are willing to let them.  It didn’t lead into any awkward conversations, it didn’t make him instantly gay. All it did was teach him that people can love whoever they wish, and to deny them the right to marry each other makes you a big mean stink bug.  Accurate description for those who try to use their religion or personal prejudice to spew hate, and deny anyone their rights.It’s a simple and lovely way to introduce a child to same sex relationships without it being too complex, or “suggestive” as some have called it.",15808,9093,Children Books,4.9,4.6,8,0.0

I don't understand how any Kindle version of a book would not be compatible with a Kindle device... Maybe because of the graphics?  The only way to know whether or not something is compatible with your device is to actually purchase from that device. I'm more frustrated about that than this particular book being unavailable, as I make most of my purchases on other devices and believe I'm sending items to my Kindle for future reading. Now I don't know if all of my purchases are accounted for. The customer service rep said she would be sure to bring this matter up during the weekly management meeting. I am such a frequent Amazon shopper that I can honestly say that this is a very atypical experience, and won't prevent my future purchases, but am glad I'm now aware.The rep was polite and responsive and immediately offered a refund when I informed her of the problem, but I chose to send it to my phone instead, as I'm expecting the hardcover version eventually.

2022-10-11,True,5,"Well worth the wait. The first few books were released each year, but the latest have taken longer to get published. With good reason as they are lengthier books, and the illustrator also took longer to complete due to mental health illness. Sadly, this will be the last Harry Potter book Jim Kay illustrates. He says: ""I have been struggling with mental health illness for some time, and it would be wrong to try and continue when I can no longer give the fans and the series the full commitment and energy it deserves.""So many of the reviews here complain about having fewer illustrated pages. This isn't a children's picture book to expect every single page to have illustrations. I praise each painting that is included, even if it might feel like fewer due to the size of this book. They are skillful paintings lovingly created by an expert in his craft. Even if hypothetically there were no paintings at all, the quality of the pages and overall book are well worth the price of any hardback.The Order of the Phoenix has much more detail, and the use of color has been more methodically planned. While there are some bright pictures, there isn't often something happy occurring. Bright sunsets set almost an even broodier tone with the characters being deep in contemplation in contrast to the bright scene. Masterfully done evoking so much feeling. I feel Jim Kay's mental health may have played a part in the feeling the paintings bring up. You can feel the anguish and sorrow in many of these. The contributing illustrator, Neil Packer, did about a quarter of the illustrations, which are very cool. Neil's are more of a layout than painting a scene, but extremely detailed.The pages themselves (even those without illustrations) take on the color tone of what the chapter is about. For example, the pages for chapters taking place in a forest are green, those with Umbridge are often pink, those with Death Eaters transition from black, dark green, purple and red. Excellent use of color throughout to set the mood.And what a mood and tone the story has! The heroes preparing themselves for what they know will come, but no one coming out of it unscathed. Good can win, but it comes at a cost.There are new characters who make things far more difficult for our young heroes than one would imagine. I always felt Umbridge was such a villain and couldn't place why her character irked me more than some of the other more murderous villains. But I think it's because she is someone we can identify in our lives who we might have met. The teacher who treated us unfairly for no reason, or the unreasonable person who criticizes every good thing we think we've accomplished. While characters like Voldemort and Lestrange are the evil we wish never to have to confront, Umbridge is the evil we face in real life.I would definitely not recommend this for children. Not just because of the length and thematic material, but some illustrations are purposely frightful. Which I imagine we can continue to expect as the stories get darker. Not a bad thing, but just know the stories progressively get scarier and despondent.Overall, a fantastic buy that I'm happy to have with the other Illustrated versions. I am sad Jim Kay will no longer be illustrating the remaining two books, but that makes this installment all the more special. Thank you, Jim Kay, for sharing these beautiful treasures with us and our hearts.Beware Amazon packing isn't always the best. They'll put it in a box often with no padding. My copy of the book came in excellent condition, but the box it arrived in was in bad shape.",6144,415,Children Books,4.9,4.5,158,0.0281
2022-10-12,True,5,The fifth illustrated edition of Harry Potter has finally arrived after a long 3 year wait.  I have definitely been looking forward to this edition as this is the longest book in the series and happens to be my favorite.  In this book so many characters “step up” showing their talent and prowess alongside Harry not to mention the development of more maturity in the characters as they face increasingly higher stakes in the magical world.  Perhaps most of all I was looking forward to Jim Kay’s illustration of the incredibly well written and despicable Dolores Umbridge.  The illustrated editions are always great because you get to see illustrations of the characters and beasts drawn exactly as they were written.  Jim Kay again does an exceptional job capturing those descriptions in illustrated form as all illustrated pages are something to look forward to as you read through the book.  They are vibrant and depict the scenes brilliantly.That being said I have to be honest and say I still miss more of the pages with background illustrations and theming illustrations we saw in the first 3 books.  I know the books are getting longer so that may be more difficult but I admit I was hoping with the additional time for this edition it would have more.  It does have some as you can see in the attached images which are great.  I am not asking for every page or chapter but perhaps those earlier books spoiled me and with how much I enjoyed background theme images.  I always enjoy the illustrated pages but the theme / background image pages are great bridges that set the mood before the next big fully illustrated page.  Again though the pages that are fully illustrated are truly captivating and it’s worthwhile to take your time looking at those so you don’t miss some of the incredibly well done small details.That being said this is a beautiful edition perfect for Harry Potter fans and really great for kids enjoying the Harry Potter world.  I found that even older kids who previously read the books love seeing the illustrations and how the characters are depicted.  The books continue to take on the darker tone that began back in book 3 as many who would be looking at reviews of this book probably know.  It depends on your family and child but compared to a book series like Lemony Snicket’s these are nowhere near as “dark”.  If you are a parent and have not read the books I would say read it (because they are great for adults also) first to see whether or not you think your child is ready but generally children 10 and up seem to handle the books well.  A great purchase that everyone will enjoy!,6144,415,Children Books,4.9,4.5,38,0.0

As an illustrator myself, I understand what a massive undertaking something like this can be, especially for a book the size of Order of the Phoenix. Also, the pressure the artist must be under to “get things right” for the fans, as well as try to meet a deadline. However, I have to say that this version is lacking compared to all the other books. As some other reviews have said, there are a lot of pages that just have a texture in the background and no illustrations. Additionally, many of the illustrations feel very rushed, scribbly and very “digital” compared to earlier books.

Now whether you agree with a boy loving mermaids or not, the theme of the need children have to be creative shines through loud and clear.  And Julian's grandmother understands that and instead of smothering his efforts she encourages him.  The illustrations are lovely and do a great job of demonstrating the fascination that Julian has with the mermaids he sees and the joy he experiences from copying what he has seen in his own way.",273,30,Children Books,4.9,4.5,4,0.0021

I wondered if they were people in flowing dresses that just looked mermaidish to a child or were people really dressed with mermaid tails. I figured it was Carnival, a drag show or some other event where people dressed up in costume. A review about there being a Coney Island Mermaid Parade clarified that for me.

Though the book doesn't mention it, the girls are certainly heading for the big mermaid parade at the borough's famous beach amusement park.Inspired, our young hero tears up the old lady's apartment and even gets into her make-up to doll himself up as a queenly African-looking mermaid with a fluffy curtain pulled down to make his tail and Grandma's potted plant raided to become a leafy headdress. Will she HIT the ceiling when she comes out of shower to see what has happened?Nope, the elderly guardian (my, she's built like Venus of Willendorf!) has given the frightened boy her blessing to nurture his deep-sea fantasy by lending her own pearls and then taking him to join in the great, colorful Coney Island Mermaid Parade, which takes place every summer.A cool, prettily illustrated book all about STILL another transgender child bravely coming out of the closet, (""I Am Jazz"" is one of such children's books on this subject, BTW), but there's still a couple of things ""wrong"" with it, IMHO.First, the mermaid parade might as well be Coney Island HOOKER Parade, especially when many girls and young women (regardless of how fit they are or NOT!) tend to wear as little as possible (their breasts are barely covered with VERY tiny pasties, for instance!) Not only that; very overweight, middle-aged men may also go HALF-NAKED as Disney's Little Mermaid. Not exactly an ideal place for wide-eyed little kids - not even the most forward-thinking ones like our Julián here.And second, while today's youngsters are happily liberated to be who and what they want to be, the dating scene many years from now may be...a little tricky, if you know what I mean.

She did express “remorse” at her decision to attempt to down-climb instead of waiting for her partner with the rope. But I was disappointed that she did not deal with some of the larger issues that led to the accident. Although Jean and Ken were experienced backcountry skiers, I was surprised that they planned to end the trip with climbing Mt. Whitney in the winter just wearing three-pin binding ski boots, when what they needed was winter mountaineering boots and crampons. They were prepared for skiing the John Muir Trail in the winter, they were not also prepared for a winter ascent of Mt. Whitney. She also remarked that they had some difficulty skiing with their X-C skis, but she never explained why they did not have metal-edge mountaineering skis.

This book will be a tale of life threatening circumstances and the author will somehow survive.  The opening shriek of ""More morphine,"" belies Jean Muenchrath's quiet, understated rendering of her ski adventure turned horribly tramatic and ultimately life changing.  A well prepared long distance ski trip over more than 200 miles on the John Muir Trail from Yosemite Valley to the summit of Mt Whitney was a multi-week adventure.  It ends with shattering fall and injuries that leave her with the very real fear that for Jean Muenchrath there may be no more mornings.Today, many who venture into the wilderness take personal locator beacons, cell or sat phones with apps that offer a safety net to speed rescue and helicopters to those in peril.  The key to understanding how desperate the situation was for Jean and her ski partner, it is important to know the year was 1982, long before such devices were standard backcountry gear.  The deep well of personal strength was all they had.This is a truly compelling read.  For background, read High Odyssey, by Gene Rose.

No worries, I can look past the title.Half the book is a telling of the story of the author's accident and survival from a fall, which, to me, doesn't read well.  It reads just like a telling of a 30 year old story with memories that are a bit fuzzy and incomplete.  Not an interesting telling of the Sierra ski trip, but just enough to get me to turn the page and see where it leads.The second half of the book is the author's path to recovery, mostly through lessons learned from Buddhism.  Religion isn't my thing, but still, Buddhism does have some nuggets of good advice on how to live the good life, which the author delves into in a manner that fits in with her personal recovery problems.  Well done on that side.My biggest complaint about the book, and this was a big one for me, was the author's complete lack with connecting on a human-to-human bases, ie, relationships.  So, her boyfriend refused to acknowledge the accident and she describes him as so very uncaring and cold, yet she marries him.  Can you please describe the relation dynamics that went into her partners behavior.  At least a little?  No?  Not at all.

I also enjoyed  and admire the author's journey after the accident on the mountain. It is only with age that one can look back and say good communication and a willingness to embrace change could have resulted in dramatically different outcomes. Sadly many (if not most) of us don't have those tools at that age. That Jean found the courage to do so eventually is remarkable.

She presents an unembellished picture of the agony she endured and goes on to share how the incident impacted her life.Self-knowledge and persistence have been key to Ms. Muenchrath’s recovery and Buddhism has also been a part of that healing.

The fuzzys still come off here and there but this is one of the better dog toys ive gotten and im happy. Will be buying again if they break their old one.,1254,131,Pet Supplies,4.5,,3,0.0002

No more ducks. I will never understand. I am convinced this duck alone started the most (out of character) fight between our dogs!!

I decided to let my dog play with the one I had just received, and she was able to chew it to pieces in less than a half hour.

He did like the crinkle sound but was frustrated that the squeaker was in the beak and not a great spot for him to get a grip.  It made me sad.  To appease my golden retriever,  I opened up the neck and added stuffing in it.  Now it’s much better.  But he still likes his other stuffed ducks better.

2020-12-14,True,4,"This is my dog Murphy’s absolute favorite toy of all time. I’m so glad I tried one of these out. It has a handle for human hand gripping or tug-of-war play, it squeaks, and it does well as a casual throw ball. Every time he breaks one I plan on just buying another.Having said that, nothing is perfect. There are things that definitely could be improved upon:1) Durability: The ball isn’t super durable considering the price. Murph isn’t a “super chewer” by any means, but he’s a large German Shepherd and he bites hard on it. Our first one of these we bought him, he had the speaker out within a week, and  over the course of a few weeks he completely dismantled the ball. Until one day I came home and little red pieces were all over my floor where a ball used to be. I ordered him a second one, and he and his sister (also a German Shepherd) had the squeaker out the day it arrived and I gave it to them. This one hasn’t been completely torn apart yet but it’s got some big holes in it. That’s not the biggest deal, as long as he still plays with it I’m not bothered by whether it squeaks or not. However, poor Murph seems disappointed every time it stops squeaking. I think it’s his favorite part. I wish the squeaker would stick around a bit longer, but like I said. Not a deal breaker. However, at this price point I’m not sure it’s worth purchasing twice a month. This ball has yet to last more than 2 weeks in our house, and none of our dogs are aggressive chewers. We’ve got some cheap chuck it balls we’ve had for years. I would’ve happily paid more for them if I had to. But this is why I took one star off this ball; I was hoping for more usage and time before having to replace it.2) Incorrect Advertising: this really isn’t a big deal, and I certainly didn’t give my rating with this in mind, but the ball is advertised as blue. Both times I ordered the blue one and both times I was sent a red one. Not a big deal at all, Murph doesn’t care and neither do I. It was just weird. Why advertise for a blue ball if your product is red?Despite those two things, I really do love this ball. It’s easy to find in the yard. My boy loves it. If he drops it on my foot (which he loves doing almost as much as he loves the ball) it’s not gonna break it. It won’t break his teeth. He even sleeps with it at night. To me, this ball is still worth purchasing despite the above-mentioned gripes. 4/5 stars!",16,4,Pet Supplies,3.8,,1,0.0

My puppy is a cane corso that is now 8 months old, about 85 lbs, and a HUGE chewer. Typical toys last anywhere from a day to week. This is the ONLY chew toy that can withstand him chewing and squishing it. The only damage from the last 5 months is the squeaker came out, which I'm actually very grateful for.

Not 100% of course, as there is the new toy learning curve to consider. But i expect she will have it down 100% soon enough. Plus some funs along with it!As for the quality of the treat toy, it arrived in great just off the shelf condition, no defects or damage to be seen. The toy looks and feels solid enough for what it is. The toy does function properly. No assembly required plus it did arrive with 1 extra trapdoor piece. I guess just in case like a nice shirt with an extra button on the tag. The colors are bright and fun. It is easy for hoomans to understand and operate.Overall, I do expect this toy to last quite a while, assuming of course that it does not become a victim of nom nomming. It is solid, but not indestructable.My personal experience recommendations are for hoomans to supervise treat toy play time and then immediately put the treat toy away out of reach when play time is done. This should avoid the nom noms. Also, I strongly suggest only using solid hard treats or at least medium hard treats. If you use anything gooey, sticky, soft, mushy, juicey, etc, you will never clean it fully out of every last crack, groove, and hole. Lastly, use small bits, pieces, or pinches of the treats or they wont fit well in the holes etc. The treat tpy cant function properly if the treats dont fit and the goo clogs the hinges up.But hey, no toy is 100% perfect!

2023-06-15,True,3,When I first got this I LOVED it.  It's great looking.  My cat loved the water faucet like style (she loves to drink from the water faucet).  Easy to set up.  Easy to fill up.  Easy to clean.  No assembly.  But after tap water had been in the base for a few weeks when I opened it to fill it the water was slimy.  Most all cat water fountains I have purchased in the past has all the water in an post-filtered pool where the water is constantly being oxygenated by water movement so there is no stagnant water.  I now have to change the base water every other day and to further help with purity I use only filtered water when I fill it up.  Extra steps I think the fountain itself should take care of.,12,8,Pet Supplies,4.4,,1,0.0006
2023-05-17,True,2,"Pros: Large enough bowl for a border collie and two cats to share without refilling constantly.  It’s much more attractive than others I’ve purchased. It’s very quiet- I only heard it if the level was getting low, then it sounded like a trickle. It’s very easy to put together and take apart. It’s real stainless steel. Most of it… which leads me to the following:Con: I’ve had this since April 20th, 2023. I’ve taken it apart and washed each little part by hand each week. I’ve changed the filters per the manufacturer’s recommendations. Tonight, I began taking it apart to do my weekly cleaning and noticed this plastic piece (pictured) was so disgustingly yellow. The picture is after it’s been hand washed, ran through my dishwasher and then sat in a glass of bleach and water for about 10 minutes. I cannot get it clean. FYI: it’s the piece that the copper spout locks into.I really wish that the manufacturer would let me know how to purchase a replacement plastic piece bc this fountain really is the best I’ve ever owned; however,  it’s unusable at this point.",7,5,Pet Supplies,4.4,,2,0.0001

Ability to see how full it is without having to take the cover off. I wish it had a LED light that could indicate this. The ones these replaced were made of plastic and had a little light that turned red if they ran too low. This was a rare occurrence because I tended to be on top of refilling. What else I would change? The upper filter, the white one, is a little small for the size of the unit. I change it a lot along with the black foam one. I have multiple long haired pets so maybe that effects it but it can be easily remedied with a redesign. Overall, the pets like it and it is pretty low maintenance.",44,11,Pet Supplies,4.4,,12,0.0013
2023-02-21,True,4,"This is a nice water fountain - easy to clean, quiet, and works well.  That being said, I have one BIG complaint.  The description for this item says it has a ""buckle"" that acts as the cord guide for the pump.  That's misleading!  It's not a buckle at all, it's merely a plastic guard for the cord.  Nothing holds the lid down, and if you have smart, active cats, like I do, you'll have a problem.  Even though the lid sits down in the reservoir, cats can lift up on the cord guard or the water spout and pull the lid off!  I've had this fountain for just 5 days now, and my two Ragdolls have pulled the top off twice!  That means your pump will be running dry until you discover it, which in our case has been at night while we're sleeping so who knows how long it was running dry until we found it!  Everyone knows that running the pump dry will cause it to burn out eventually, so I'd consider that a pretty major design flaw!I contacted Tomxcute today (2/21/2023) to ask if they have a clamp they can provide  to correct this design flaw.  Hopefully they will address this promptly, otherwise this fountain is getting returned and I'll be back to the drawing board, trying to find a fountain that our cats can't take apart.",44,11,Pet Supplies,4.4,,16,0.0007

I use water bottles 16.9oz and the pineapple fountain I had was able to hold 8 bottles adding up to 135.2 oz (4L) but this fountain only held up to 6 bottles which takes 101.4oz.

2023-06-28,True,5,"One of the better designs when it comes to water fountains I've found, at least aesthetically. I love the brass-colored spout. You never hear a motor, but I really like the very quiet sounds of the water running. It's very faint, only heard when it's dead silent in the house.At night and when all the lights are off, this water fountain gives off a little blue nightlight that I find very cool and helpful. Most importantly, my cats seem to really enjoy it! I still like to put regular water bowls throughout the room and house just in case, plus they get a lot of wet food. Still, so far, this water fountain is working well.Do I find it tedious and complicated to take apart and clean? Yeah, that's why I'm usually hesitant to buy water fountains. I'm lazy and always worried about these things failing eventually, but!!! I decided to splurge and take a gamble on this fountain, because I do want to encourage good hydration for my kitties.I still need to see if it stands the test of time and will keep being diligent in its maintenance.  Again, I'm definitely enjoying this product so far. I love the design and it seems to be functioning well.",257,88,Pet Supplies,4.4,,15,0.0005
2023-05-28,True,5,"At one time, finding a quality (noise-free) pet water fountain, required that you pay upwards of $79.95 and more.  And even then, the motors used, and the materials used (mostly plastic), meant that you heard a constant hum from the pumps.  So I've long held off even looking for pet water fountains - that is until recently.Over the past year or so, I've come to discover that any reservations I had, went away with my first purchase of one of these water fountains.  Right now I have 3 of these (different designs and shapes of course), but I made sure to get the ones that use the same water pumps, filters and black charcoal bands.  This is important because these Chinese-made water fountains are often made by the same company, yet marketed under different brand names.  Many of these may look different, but many of the pumps used, the filters, and more are all the same internally.  Now to clarify, there are different styles available that use different types of filters also.  So keep this in mind as you look for some.  This also saves you the hassle of having to purchase a variety of different filter shapes if you are using more than one water fountain.This Tomxcute water fountain is totally silent, holds a good amount of water (I check on it weekly), and once filled, you can just forget about it - I'd say for up to a week.  It's always good to check water levels and wipe down the interior as the metal coverings can get a bit slimy after a period of 10 days to 2 weeks.  The filters do a good job of keeping the water clean, catching animal fur and other debris, and your cats/dogs can become quite used to using these types of fountains in no time at all.  In my opinion, it's always better to get the stainless steel versions, rather than paying for a plastic fountain (where you can hear the pump noise much more clearly plastic tends to rattle more).As an aside, I also have 2 other water fountains, shaped differently, but the pumps and the filters are the same, so it worked out superbly (I have 4 cats).The bottom line is that these types of water fountains are inexpensive, are built quite well, are easy to maintain and clean, and the cats take to them quickly.I give this one 5 stars (along with the other 2 that I own).",257,88,Pet Supplies,4.4,,48,0.0003

I just have to keep fingerprints (and kitty nose prints) wiped off occasionally and it looks perfect.I have not had the issue with the spout being delicate--however the top it tough to lift when there is water on it, and I can imagine if you pull hard on the spout it might loosen. No big deal, I'll just be gentle.I wish there was a way to tell how much water there is in it without lifting the top, but that would mean a plastic window would have to be on it somewhere and that would ruin the sleek appearance of the fountain.It's also super-quiet!

2023-04-01,True,5,"So my dogs can get pretty tired of regular bones and the tennis balls after a while. I wanted to switch things up for them and came across this set of toys.To start, it was packaged really nicely. Once I opened the box I was really impressed with the amount of toys you get! Online pictures don't seem to do it justice, this box was packed pretty dang full. My dogs absolutely LOVE these. They get to choose what they want to play with and they each already have a favorite. It's absolutely adorable.The rope toys are super sturdy too, my husky loves tug-of-war and these are awesome for that. The ball variety is great, some a little softer, some harder, a few rope style even! The peanut makes a squeak noise and boy, that really made them happy. The poop emoji is so funny, my kids think it's hilarious to watch the dogs play around with it.This set isn't like other styles I've purchased.  This one includes dog training tools like a clicker and dog bell(which is so cute by the way)  and even poo bags/a clip carrier for the bags. I have always had to buy toys and training things separately and I really think that because it's included together with this, it really sets it a part from similar toy sets!The toy box might be my favorite bit though, the fact that I have a place to put the toys for the dogs is really nice. It's a simple toy ""bin"" and it has handles, plenty of room for the toys themselves. Super cool addition to this pack!All in all, 10/10 would recommend.  The toys are sturdy, a huge variety and training items too. Can't get a better deal than that!",270,64,Pet Supplies,4.5,,1,0.0

They're definitely tough!I love how it not only  comes with soooo many toys but also training tools (a bell and a clicker) AND poop bags with a little dispenser!

She’s a super chewer, but I’ve found that giving her toys that are hard for her to break through makes her upset so this pack is great because when she tears through one she can go straight to the next. I’ve been thinking about getting her a bell for a while now, so that being in the pack is a cool added bonus. Also, I was worried the bin for the toys might be flimsy, but it’s nice and sturdy.

But our 9 week old puppy kept switching up which one he chewed or played with. We have a senior dog who loved the larger squeaky peanut. This set is not for aggressive chewers or larger dogs.

2023-06-17,False,2,"I've been using a silicone body scrubber to clean my dog for almost a year now.  It works well to clean my dog while also helping to collect her hair in the process.  When I saw this set I thought it was a brilliant idea.  It was essentially what I'd already been doing on my own, only with the ability to fill with soap at the start and not have to worry about managing the slippery bottle and my slippery dog at the same time.The set comes with three pieces.  One that's meant to hold pet shampoo and two that can be used to scrub your dog and gather hair.  The set has a very cheap look and feel to it.  The shampoo scrubber has a flexible reservoir and a silicone cap that prevents the shampoo from coming out the top once filled.  The bristled area (which is soft because it's made from silicone) has small holes in the center where the shampoo comes out from.  The piece can be squeezed to encourage the shampoo to come out and is soft enough that it won't cause your pet any discomfort.  The other two scrubbers have adjustable straps so that you can fit them snuggly onto your hand.  The nubs on these are shorter and work really well for gathering hair that sheds while bathing.I was really pleased with the two scrubbers in this set.  It did an amazing job of collecting hair and the hair was also simple to remove from the scrubbers as well.  It was easy to adjust and hold and worked much better than the silicone body scrubbers I'd been using prior to ordering this set.  The shampoo/brush combo is awful.  I had such a hard time getting the shampoo to come out when I wanted it to.  I would squeeze the scrubber and the soap would hardly come out.  I ended up taking the top off and dumping the soap on the dog and then washing her with the brush part.  It didn't work as advertised at all and I was really disappointed.  I'm happy with the other scrubbers, but the whole point of ordering this set was for the shampoo brush.It's not a very expensive set, but I'm willing to bet you can get scrubbers like this for less money.

2022-09-11,True,5,"Best PracticesHello everyone, I wanted to give you all some tips and tricks I have learned to use these pills with the greatest efficacy possible. You see I can promise you without question these pills work and work very well. However many of your bodies are not in the right condition to support massive growth. So I am going to tell you how to get the best results you can in the least time possible.Body typesUnhealthy: as for those of you who do not live a unhealthy life style I regret to inform you you will see the least results of any group of people if any at all. The body needs several building blocks to support growth. These include Amino Acids, Protein and vitamins. If you are eating like crap all day your body has nothing to work with to make you larger down there. You body knows what it must do but doesn’t have the resources to do it, so chances are nothing will happen to youAverage: people who are average will have a much easier time than those who do not eat well. Most average peoples diets vary between healthy and unhealthy food. Limited resources are better than no recourses. As such you should be growing about a inch every month give it take. However you would be getting them far faster if you took good care of yourselfFit: those of you who work out regularly and take great care of yourself will achieve explosive results very quickly. You are already giving you body all the fuel it needs to build muscle. And the penis is a type of muscle, Bulbospongiosis for all you nerds out there. So making it grow will be extremely easy. I work out six days a week and am dedicated to my training. Thanks to that in just 5 days I went up by half a inch. And in 25 I was at my goal of 8 inches. And very thick as wellHow to tell if it workingAs is with growing in any regard for the human body you will experience pain as you go. Your muscle fibers are reworking themselves for growth and as such you will experience anything from a dull ache to a small sharp pain. If you start feeling that no matter what you do DO NOT STOP. That’s how you know it is working and your getting bigger. When I was on the pills, the days I hurt the most were the ones I found myself looking bigger down their the next dayWhat to do if you don’t want to work outFor any of you who detest working out there is still a way you can achieve amazing results very quick. It all revolves around eating totally clean and taking supplements. I highly recommend fish oil and amino acid supplements as these two already support healthy brain function but in tandem with the pills it makes you get large much quicker. Additionally I recommend you eat chicken, Yogurt, Oatmeal, steak, rice, broccoli and rice cakes just to name a few. All of these foods contain the vital nutrients you need to get big quick. Plus you feel amazing and your physique will improve to so there really are no downsides here.Overall these pills work amazing and I highly recommend them to anybody who wants to be able to blow a women away when you pull down your pants ;)",376,52,Health Supplements,3.3,,191,0.0
2023-07-13,True,4,"I tried using these vacuum storage bags for the first time today.  I like the way they compress contents and save space.  I will say my work isn't as tidy looking and flat as illustrated.  As for creating 80% extra storage space as stated, I think that means 1.8x, a little less than double extra storage space.  Please disregard if my reasoning is faulty.I can read but I skipped over the statement regarding different sized storage bags.  The jumbo bags are the ones I like.  The others I found less useful.  But there is one thing I find misleading.  It says it's a 20 pack of vacuum storage bags.  It's really 16 vacuum storage bags and 4 roll compression storage bags.  I guess that they will work, maybe better if two people worked at it, rolling the bag, sitting on it, or whatever.  The double-zip seal requires both hands.  And I had some difficulty using the double zipper.  For me it worked better to stand the bags on end when trying to use the zipper.  If nothing is in the bag and the zipper is flat, I'm sure it would slide easily.  In the real world trying to stuff items in the bag, creates more of a bulge in the middle, and I had to work at it to get the bag sealed.  Once sealed, I was able to use the hand pump and was pleased with the results on all the vacuum bags.  For ""springy"" items such as pillows, I found it easier to put the pillows in first and add sheets, blankets, or whatever nearer zipper.Overall, I'm pleased.

When you take them out of the box, you don't know the size unless you measure the actual bag.  While putting unused blankets, clothing, etc. in the bag for future use and to save space in storage, it would be very helpful to have that information on the bag.  A simple trick we found was to use a permanent marker and write on the bag the size dimensions.  We did each corresponding bag for future use.  That way we would not have to measure each bag later.  Nice clear bags and easy to use.  It  even comes with a pump that would fit in a suitcase for travel.  I use my vacuum at home, but you don't have that when camping or on the road.

I packed the bags tight and then vacuumed the air out It really compressed the contents to the point that what was left was actually very hard and not easily reformed if you are going to try to store them the best way is to not just force the clothes in but to stack it so it takes a stackable shape.

We have a giant ottoman so that was the perfect spot, otherwise it could fit under a bed, maybe even stacking a couple, depending on the thickness.

If you nick any corner or slide them to hard or are too rough stacking in a tight space they get teeny holes.

2023-06-26,True,3,"I've been searching for a replacement for Space Bags, since they're no longer available. I bought the 20-pack of these, to pack items for a move. I've used half of the bags so far. One of the jumbo bags kept losing the suction overnight. The third time that I sealed it, I noticed that there was not a pink gasket under the cap (likely never had been). I checked the other still-sealed bags, which all had the gasket in place. When I came back to Amazon to request a replacement or complain, the only options given both involved packing up all the bags and sending them back. I don't have time to unpack the bags that are still sealed. There's also no way to contact ""Cozy Essentials"" which I assume means that they're an Amazon company/product. So, if you purchase these otherwise-fantastic bags, make sure that all of them have the pink gasket.",3595,491,Travel,4.4,,4,0.0358
2023-06-09,True,3,"I tried to use the roll up travel bags included in this purchase.  The box's directions say to fill, close the zipper, roll up, and the air will escape so the volume should shrink.  As you can see from the photos, I purchased the product (last December, thinking I would use the bags in the future). I tried filling, zipping, and squeezing as directed but the air did not come out.  So I emptied it to use only the air in the bag.  The photo shows that even rolling up the bag, the air never came out...i.e. the bag did not shrink.  The other bags have a nozzle where you use the included pump to remove air.  Those bags worked very well!  Since the purchase it's well beyond the return date, with this review I would ask the company to send four bags (that use the pump to deflate) to replace the defective roll up bags.

There are literally 4 instructions on the back of the box, which certainly seem simple enough…until you come to the near end of the rolling process, when the items are apparently blocking the valves, so you’re left w/about 25% of the bag just trapped w/air. Since there are no parameters given, like how many items one bag will hold, where to situate them to avoid the clog @ the end, or if there’s a particular way to roll the items to eliminate this issue, they are a complete waste of time & money. I never would have guessed such an easy premise could be an abject failure. I didn’t have time to find a like product that actually worked so I had to spend a great amount of my time wrestling w/these stupid things struggling to get to a point where I could kind of utilize them.

2023-06-28,True,2,"Rating: ★★☆☆☆Pros:Space-Saving Solution: The vacuum bags offer an excellent storage solution for maximizing space. By removing excess air, these bags efficiently compress clothing, bedding, and other items, allowing you to store more in less space. It's a great way to declutter closets and optimize storage areas.Protective and Durable: The vacuum bags are made of durable material that effectively protects your belongings from dust, moisture, and pests. This feature ensures that your stored items remain clean and fresh, especially for long periods or when storing seasonal items.Easy-to-Use System: The vacuum bags are straightforward to use, thanks to their user-friendly design. The sealing mechanism is secure and simple, requiring minimal effort to create an airtight seal. Additionally, the transparent design allows you to easily identify the contents of each bag.Cons:Hand Pump Efficiency: The included hand pump falls short in terms of efficiency. It requires significant effort and repetitive pumping to extract the air from the bags fully. This can be time-consuming and tiring, particularly when dealing with multiple bags or larger items.Durability of Hand Pump: The hand pump's construction leaves something to be desired. Over time, some users have reported issues with the pump's durability, such as handles breaking or the pumping mechanism becoming less effective. This reliability concern raises doubts about its long-term functionality.Limited Compatibility: The hand pump provided with the vacuum bags may not fit well or work optimally with all bag sizes or brands. This lack of compatibility can be frustrating, as it restricts the versatility and convenience of using the bags with other pumps or vacuum machines.Overall, the vacuum bags offer an efficient and space-saving storage solution, effectively protecting your belongings from dust and moisture. However, the hand pump included in the package falls short in terms of efficiency and durability. Its labor-intensive operation and limited compatibility are areas that require improvement. While the vacuum bags themselves are highly useful, potential buyers should consider alternative options for extracting air from the bags unless improvements are made to the hand pump.",1423,517,Travel,4.4,,0,1.0

2022-12-31,True,2,"Disclaimer: I did not receive bags that have the blue center spot for the blue pump as some reviews pictured so I cannot say if this applies to those.The bags I received have a double zipper on the top which is not the actual closure of the zip lock, but a way to put pressure on the zip locks to securely seal them. It doesn't matter what side the zipper tab is on when the items are in the bags. The first bag I used would not push air out and I couldn't figure out where it was supposed to come out. I finally realize that the bottom of the bag had 2 air holes - 1 on each side. The air holes were connected across the bottom with little outlets from the main bag into this ""tube"" of air for lack of better description. The issue is that those air holes do not opening nicely. Once I found the one outlet, I was able to half pull apart the tube along the bottom for the air to go out. The problem is they don't stay open and as I got to the end of the rolling, the items inside push to the bottom and cover the air holes. I had to lay on top of my bags after each roll to push as much air out as possible. If I was using for storage, it wouldn't be a big deal because I was able to force most of the air out; however, I was trying to use for travel to reduce to a carry on vs checked bag and without the air fully gone, they don't tack up much less space than if I just packed normally.

I packed a large blanket, pillow and sheets and I could have easily doubled what I put in.The only thing you really need to pay attention to is how you layer/shape the items you put in the bags, it sucks all the air out and makes it difficult to manipulate after to fit-my example is trying to fit that large bag of bedding into a duffel bag.Overall it was a great purchase.",28204,2073,Travel,4.4,,5,0.0001
2023-07-18,True,5,"This was a game changer when we needed to pack winter clothes for our trip. It sucked all the air out of the insulated jackets and snow bibs and even saved some space with the regular clothes. I also pack it on regular trips now because if I need more space after buying things to come home, I just seal up my clothes in the bags and instant space :) I normally travel with packing cubes, but since I just need space on the way home, I wasn't as concerned with organization. The ""travel roll bags"" in the set were not my favorite though. You are able to ""roll"" the air out, but it takes a bit long (in my opinion) to slowly squeeze tha air out. And even then there's still more air in it than the suction bags. But it allowed the bags to be a little more malleable, if that's what you need when fitting things into your bag. The vacuum-sealed bags are not able to be bent of anything once the air is sucked out so need to keep that in mind when considering the shapes of the things you have to pack. The clothes also get ""hard"" when compressed, so they won't be soft and cushiony for fragile items.Awesome that they also provide the hand pump...I didn't need to hunt for a vacuum on the trip and the pump is quick and easy to operate -- no batteries required :) It's also small enough to pack in your bag...even more so since you are saving so much space with the compression bags ;p Need to be careful that you don't overpack and make the bag too heavy, but for space purposes, this was amazing!Also used the larger bags for home storage -- great for all the bedding, towels, and for storing the winter clothes when not in use :)",28204,2073,Travel,4.4,,33,0.0001

2014-05-17,True,4,"I agree with many of the other reviewers that this tool is expensive. However, I bit the bullet and used this tool to drill holes to install 50+ cabinet pulls. I didn’t want to make the expensive mistake of ruining thousands of dollars worth of cabinet doors.Two features I would improve about this tool:1) The horizontal alignment of the jig seems to be off by 1-2mm. When I drill holes in a cabinet door with the handle installed on the left hand side (measurement markings on the tool facing me) then no problem. The holes are perfectly centered where I want them to be. When I drill holes on the adjacent cabinet door with the handle installed on the right hand side (measurement markings on the tool facing the door), then the holes are slightly off center by 1-2mm. This may not matter to a casual observer, but I know that the holes are off center by a little bit.2) I used a plastic clamp and a piece of folded cardboard underneath the “T” to support the tool against the cabinet door. Placing a piece of metal on each side of the “T” may be a good idea to improve this tool. This would make the “T” the same width as the adjustable jigs. I placed my clamp right on top of the “T” with the cardboard underneath.Other useful hints:1) Make sure to use a drill with a bubble level so that your hole is straight in a vertical orientation.2) Make sure to pay attention that your drill bit is placed at 90 degrees to the face of the cabinet door, otherwise your holes will not be straight in a horizontal orientation.3) Use a clamp and a piece of folded cardboard underneath the “T” to support the tool against the cabinet door.4) This jig is good, but it still will not save you from making careless mistakes. It is only a guide for the drill bit.Would I buy this tool again? Sure. It is obvious that the tool manufacturer reads these reviews, because I received a version of the tool that was slightly different than what was described in earlier reviews. My tool came with adjustable screw knobs instead of the Allen wrench screws that everyone else complained about.",152,53,Tools,4.8,,4,0.0002
2020-03-24,True,4,"I would still strongly recommend hand measuring; for some reason when I tried using the ""center"" according to the tool it was off a little. Otherwise, I think this jig is pretty good. Once you're done setting it for the first time, it saves you a ton of time by giving you consistent drill spacing from the edges of the cabinet doors. I drilled the handles for 23 different cabinet doors and installed handles in about an hour, and the results were great.However, there are a couple of big problems I have with this tool. The first is with installing anything on drawers. The instructions say to mark the center of the top of the drawer with a line and then just line up the notch on the ""Large Stop"" with that line. Why didn't they just put a hole in the Large Stop so can you line up your drawn line with hash marks outside the hole? It matters because when you push the tool flush with the face of the cabinet, there's a chance for it to move. I would almost recommend buying the more expensive version that comes with the arm extensions to prevent this, but I'm not sure if that's worth the extra $110.The second problem I have is with shaker cabinet drawers. I would strongly recommend putting a shim or something behind the tool before drilling. If you don't, when you push the tool against the drawer, the bottom (where you drill) might swing in, and you could drill at an angle. The arm extensions would also prevent this from happening.Otherwise, though, it's a great tool.",152,53,Tools,4.8,,0,0.0091

It was dead accurate for my entire kitchen.LIKES: It's quality black anodized aluminum. Very good. It is very accurate and didn't slip. Very trustworthy device.DISLIKE. Didn't come with everything. For the price they should include the extras for larger drawers. Stupid to separate into some ADD-ON option kits. That made me feel like they got me, now I need to buy more and more.

2018-08-22,True,4,"This thing definitely speeds thing up, just used it to install about 100 pulls of different sizes on a bunch of doors and drawers, which is a typical size project for us.However, you need to be careful.The 5mm drill bit that comes with it works fine., The bit's flutes will clog up when drilling hardwoods like maple so be sure to run the bit out to clear the flutes before you drill through and you will not have any blowouts.It will scratch the cabinet if you don't put tape all over it, which makes it look kind of ridiculous. Some thin rubber padding on the surfaces that touch the cabinets would really make this thing a lot safer to use.The center hole is nice, definitely made it easy to use by marking center lines for the pulls on drawers, which is the fastest way to a lot of the same height but different width drawers. Though if the lines were extended along the sides/edges to where they touch the face of the drawer or door I wouldn't have to peep through the center hole when lining it up.Also be sure to check the thumbscrews often, a couple of times one of them loosened up while I was drilling, which was as little scary but not the disaster it could have been, just reset it and was good to goit is a little crazy that, for that price, it comes in a cardboard box, which I am gonna get rid of and make/find a better one since you can't put it back in the box without changing the setting.Anyway, besides all that I do really like this thing and recommend it for those who regularly install a lot of cabinet hardware.",152,53,Tools,4.8,,42,0.012

I have a couple of wide cabinets and after a lot of research I opted to buy this jig since it was the only one long enough for the job. Even though I wasn’t thrilled about the price all the other buyers seemed pleased.When it was time to start to use the jig I went ahead and measured three times to make sure I got the correct measurement and that all cabinets were the same. I configured the jig and I started with a door pull on a wall cabinet (rookie mistake). After drilling the first hole, I noticed that the jig had slipped and it was no longer on the edge of the door panel :(. So I had to reconfigure the jig with the new distance using the first hole as the guide to position my second hole. After that it was very repeatable even though everything was seated a bit lower than desired. I’m summary, I’ve only done the cabinet doors (drawers are next) and I’m pleased with how easy it is. My only suggestion to the company is that for the price they should include a clamp or at least make note of it on the instructions. I’ll add more information when I do the drawers and use the extension.",152,53,Tools,4.8,,1,0.0001
2021-01-16,True,4,"Hot tip for everyone is you better keep the paper packaging that the hard case comes in because those are your instructions. I cut that into manageable pieces that would fit inside the hard case so I have instructions inside the hard case. The only thing that is terrible on this unit is the plastic bit of the hard case that is intended to house to extension ruler. That is probably the only thing the manufacturer outsources. So all the components that the manufacturer directly makes are excellent. The rotomolded plastic case has some inaccuracy inside. I fixed it with my dremel. I do recommend getting the hard case regardless, because you need to keep your precious tool safe, and the case does do that. It has quality hinges and latches that are not likely to ever break.I did a bunch of cabinet doors and drawers with this.

Having the accurate measure scales is a huge plus and a time saver. My old jig required me to use a tape measure everytime I set it up, or changed from one size to another. The reason for 4 stars...the price. I understand that this is a specialized tool, and it is designed well for the job it's made for. I have no complaints about the tool, case, accessories etc. Just that darn price. I fought with myself on whether to pull the trigger on a fairly high dollar purchase, and I'm happy I did, in the long run. But $300 was a good portion of the price of a new miter saw that I needed after mine finally gave up. If you need a well built, well-designed hardware jig, this is that jig.

I bought the full kit which included the bars to lay out shelf pins. I assumed you could combine the two bars to make a long run of adjustable shelf pins. Not the case, they don't maintain spacing and it screws everything up. This to me is a pretty big oversight. If they had machined the bars correctly when you place them end to end it would all lay out. Instead you have to either do small sections or try and figure out the math to make it work.There customer service is top notch.

I have been using a jig made by EZ Jig for all those years, which works very well for a lot less money. The problem is that it does not do handles that are wider than about 6"", and there is no quick adjustment. This is where this jig shines.Most of my jobs involve installing knobs or handles which are 6"" or less. But because of a current job which required installing a variety of very long handles, I finally decided to pay the price for this jig. It worked VERY well and I am glad I bought it.Pros:AccurateWell-machinedLight weightEasy to adjust with no toolsCons:Over-priced in my opinion. I certainly do not mind paying higher prices for higher quality, and this is higher quality, but not THAT high. I was once a machinist and I can appreciate the quality of the machining on the parts for this jig, but I think it's over-priced. Having said this, it will pay for itself in my line of work.Cheap cardboard case. At this price, one would expect it to come in a decent molded case of some sort. Every other tool at this price does.

2015-04-17,True,4,Very easy to use.  Ensured that each set of holes were in the same location for each door.  My wife is very picky about details and this jig was able to meet her expectations.Would have given 5 stars but it's difficult to keep the thumb screws tight in guide placement.  Having some nylon locker on the threads or lock washer would be helpful.Almost drilled a set of holes in wrong place but caught it as I had both marked holes with fine tip sharpie and double checked alignment of jig with existing holes.  This only happened once as I would check thumb screws after drilling every pair of doors.Being able to flip jig for left / right or upper/ lower is a gem.  Also the storage box will ensure the jigs longevity and prevent it from being banged around with other tools.  Box makes it easy to store.Forget about the fixed position plastic jigs.  If your doing multiple door / drawer layouts with different spaced hardware this is what you want.FYI - I was using 96mm spaced hardware.

That being said this is great for me. Worth the money IMO.Two things to note where there is room for improvement.  Although I dont have an issue with maring cabinets during drilling I can see how it could happen. Small felt pads should be added to contact areas. Not to much to ask considering the price of this. Also the drill bit included is absolute trash. Again for the price of this unit they could have cut 4 more dollars from profit to add a better bit.

Was very impressed with the reviews and initially when the TP135 arrived.However, things went downhill from there.I agree with others that the included drill bit is laughable, and they would be better off just not including it.Ultimately I ruined 2 drawer fronts and 1 cabinet door, which will cost me $300 to replace.On the first drawer, the horizontal slide loosened and got out of alignment. I cranked it down as much as possible (without using vise grips- which would have damaged the soft metal). After tightening the locking screws after each drawer (which shouldn’t be necessary), I wasn’t at all confident in this very expensive tool. It was certainly slowing the process down. Finally I ended up taping the horizontal slides so they wouldn’t move- again...this is a $300 tool.Door 1 was ruined as the vertical clamp loosened- guess I should have figured that so I ended up taping it as well.Drawer 2 was ruined as somehow the metal of tool was scored ( the metal is very soft) and scratched the front of the cabinet.The retaining screw(s) literally would fall out from the minimal vibration of my Ryobi cordless drill.I installed all handles in one day, but will not use this again and prefer to go a much cheaper option that will get better results.",35,19,Tools,4.8,,54,0.0

2020-03-06,True,3,"To be honest, I was pretty disappointed with this. I purchased this to help me install our kitchen handles on our new cabinets. It got the very best reviews of any similar tool, and I wanted to make sure our kitchen renovations finished up with perfectly positioned cabinet handles and knobs, so I bit the bullet and went for this over the much cheaper plastic ones. The main criticism of the plastic ones were their inaccurate measurements and lack of durability.This tool was very accurate with measurements (the rulers printed on the tool were 100% accurate) and it was easy to use for the most part, even for someone with no experience. It seemed to initially work well with the knobs once I got the hang of it, but when it came to the handles, it just wasn’t level - the flat piece that sits on the top of the drawer or against the side of the cabinet door to keep the tool straight while drilling - it just wasn’t level. The holes after drilling were not exactly straight, and it was so frustrating; they were about 1/16” - 1/8” off. I had to maneuver the handles with washers on the screws inside the drawer to try to make them even (the few that I did with this tool). I really should’ve taken a picture, but at the time, I was more concerned with trying to fix the crooked handles on my new cabinets and figuring out if it was my error or the tool. At first, I really just assumed it was my fault. But after about the third one (I had about 25 handles to do overall, not counting knobs) and all the time I put in to measuring and double measuring and triple measuring to try and troubleshoot my potential errors, I was pretty convinced it wasn’t me. Then my husband, father-in-law, and professional contractor friend all tried this and each came to the same conclusion (all at separate times); it was not level. I imagine I probably just received a defective item, but given the price tag, it was very disappointing. I ended up returning it.I will say, other than the unlevel side piece (which is a pretty big issue as it completely contradicts the whole point of the tool), the tool was very sturdy and well made. It also came in a really nice hard case. I do think for the price it should have included more attachment options that are sold separately like for double handle drawers, etc. The other plus to this, which was the main reason I purchased it, was you could set the template to less than one inch, which on the original plastic Kregg tool I tried first from Home Depot you couldn’t set it to less than an inch. This posed a problem with centering our knobs in the cabinet door frame as they needed to be 7/8” in from the edge. This tool worked for that.",55,19,Tools,4.8,,4,0.0
2019-12-09,True,3,"Love the concept and for the long handled pulls on tall cabinet doors worked great. When trying to use on install of 13” pulls on a 22” X 5” drawer front there is no way to attach the end stop.  So trying to hold flat and steady on the center  line is very awkward ard difficult. It’s so difficult to hold completely flat on drawer front edge, it has a tendency to slant back while holding the jig on the top of the drawer edge. If the large stop were slightly bigger in order to go a little further back on drawer edge would most likely correct this problem.  It would probably work better if the drawer didn’t have a raised panel drawer front.  Should have better instructions.  The price should be a little more reasonable.",55,19,Tools,4.8,,0,0.0003
2018-01-16,True,3,This adjustable jig works pretty well and the bit it comes with is not bad. I just thought that for the price there would be some kind of bearing or replaceable bushing that would of been included because while drilling the bit kinda squeaks and feels like its going to wear out and get sloppy fast. I did 3 kitchens with it and so far its not showing any signs of wear. I also add a drop or two of oil to the bit and guide during use. The adjustability is endless and precise. Much better than making jigs out of wood and tossing them. Theres only so square you can hold your drill when making jigs yourself. I never made a perfect one without a drill press.,55,19,Tools,4.8,,3,0.0005
2016-07-17,True,3,The jig to me is worth the money. It's expensive but does save on set up time and having to build quick individual jigs. BUT.... It has nasty little problem. The stop for drilling doors has a beveled shoulder on it that can catch the drawer/door edge before the blade of the stop does... This causes about a 1/2---9/16 error in hole position. The point of this jig is to be able to set it and go... But I know find myself really double checking were it is because I don't trust it...certainly not something I would have a helper do anymore. This now takes me off more important install tasks.... So well made but not sure I won't go back to homemade jigs that don't require helper supervision.,55,19,Tools,4.8,,5,0.0001

It's more expensive than the foreign made versions, but it is built very well and works awesome.  As with most of the woodworking jigs I've used, it takes time to set it up, but once it's set, it goes really fast.  The drawers we installed were 3 different widths, so set up took a while, but once I knew what to do, it was really fast to set up too.  The cabinet doors were especially fast to drill once the jig was set up.  This was one job and it was already worth every penny.  I totally understand if you don't want to spend extra on this jig, but if you are on the fence, or if you plan on doing a lot of cabs, it's definitely worth the money.

2021-01-28,True,5,"DIY'er, about 60 handles in the new house. I've used other jigs in previous little projects, this one works much better than those imo.First, the amount of thinking put into the design of this tool makes it worth its price. Very nice build, easy to read, well-thought out. Functionally, couldn't be easier to use once set up. The kit comes in a cheap box but works well.The tool does take some practice and testing. The main stop on mine was not true when tightened down. The tightening screw on this slide is off from center, which puts a twist when tightened. There are two set screws which need to be adjusted before going crazy drilling holes. I set a small speed square against the edges and got it pretty darn close. I would check squareness of tool after every few holes, and of course after adjusting for the next handle or door size.My handles were a bunch of different sizes for each different door. I set up the tool for size #1, marked each drawer/door to drill, then just drilled all that size. Then, set up the tool for size #2, do all the doors of that size. Once set, drilling holes is super quick. My first time using the tool I did 21 (4 different sizes, from 3"" to 12"") handles in 3 hours. My next dozen doors (next day) took about 30 minutes.If you have any handle greater than 7"" on a cabinet door, or 11"" on drawer, you will need the extended rulers. If you are gonna get this tool then you are likely not one to mess around. Get the expanded kit from the get go and don't get caught shorthanded. The expansion kit is more expensive later.I was able to do a 12"" handle for a drawer front by offsetting the center mark then flipping the tool for each hole. But for handles on the doors I had to get the extensions.Overall a great tool for my collection, and worth more than its selling price for sure.(Handles in picture are also from Amazon, Koofizo brand, awesome handles).",2001,676,Tools,4.8,,4,0.0001

Only issue I had with it is, that the holes for the ruler to slide and be tightened could have been reemed.  after tapping those holes, there's material in there and it could make it difficult to slide the ruler through.  also I think due to tolerance stacking, one of my plastic pieces could be very slightly off, like one side sits higher than the other by less than 1/16"". it not noticeable in the end but I noticed it when using the hole punch.overall, I bought the aluminum unit and it's nice because it is rigid and I have dropped it a few times on accident and it withstood the abuse.",755,69,Tools,4.4,,2,0.0006
2023-01-25,True,4,Okay it’s not the $200 product and I can tell the difference. But this product comes close and works pretty much as the expensive counterpart. I saw the video tutorial on true position jig. It works similar! Great! Downside to this that could improve. The aluminum hole guides are not as tight fitted for the drill bit it’s a bit bigger. The sliding guides are not as thick in metal so they don’t flush as good as the TP tool. The thickness is thiner which can give a bit of flex make sure you hold it true with your hands and a clamp like I have in the pics. Also the jig fell off to the floor on me and the small tightening knobs one got bent luckily they have extras. It’s soft metal don’t let it fall had to sand off the ruler part had a jagged bump. There’s couple minor things that can be improved. I think with out too much cost at a good price still. I wish it had the measurements written on the ruler. Overall good product without spending over $200 and I will keep it for future projects plan on making garage cabinets.

2023-02-12,True,4,I have taken on a few dresser projects over the past few years but have recently started a project of refreshing one of our bathroom vanities. Getting perfect holes drilled to match handles is not as easy as you might think when you are just measuring and hoping that the holes line up on each handle. I decided to buy this and give it a try to relieve some of the stress that comes along with making sure you get the handles even across 8 different drawers and cabinet doors. I actually came back to the product in order to watch the video on how to set it up just to make I did it correctly and it was pretty simple. I can truthfully say that after using this I will never go back to manually measuring and drilling. One downside is that if you pull on the jig too hard you can move it just a little and end up 1/16 or 1/8 off from your original point but this is a great guide.,755,69,Tools,4.4,,2,0.0032

Good value for your money, just be prepared to spend time figuring out how to use it.  I found a couple of videos that were a great help.

I dont have it mounted in there yet but from my dry fits it's as close to perfect as I couldve gotten.I knocked a star off cuz the center punch isnt the best.

2022-03-12,True,4,"The tool seems ok but the instructions and info don’t tell you what to do with 30” drawer fronts.  Another issue is that the metal drill guide is 5mm not 3/16”. To get a hold on the center of the hole, you need a 5mm drill bit.  Furthermore, the included center punch is too small to get accurately centered.UPDATE: After using this to install a bunch of cabinet door and drawer pulls (not knobs), I found that it is adequate but could use some changes.  Primarily, the TWO screws that hold the vertical scale and horizontal scale together causes the horizontal scale to NOT be perpendicular to the vertical scale.  If you do not tighten the screws exactly the same, one end of the scale will be slightly (noticeably after handle is installed) higher or lower than the other hole.  Be sure to check with a square.  I used a small combination square to make sure the holes were at the same location and used the awl again if it was off. Regarding the larger ""drill guide"" hole - I used my 3D printer to print an insert that kept the awl in the center of the hole.  Unless you need a large hole, I would definitely not drill through the hole or use the hole a drill guide.",755,69,Tools,4.4,,3,0.0006
2022-08-31,True,4,"This jig was almost perfect. I like the aluminum construction over cheaper plastic models. Made fast work out of cabinet doors. Only criticism is having to be creative when using it in recessed panel drawers like shaker style cabinets. The jig won't lie flat in the middle of the drawer panel in order to drill pull handles. Had to create a shim out of appropriate thickness wood and attach this to the jig to fill the gap between the jig and recessed panel.  Worked just fine after that.More expensive jigs include thicker drill guides to compensate for the recess, but a little shop work makes this a cheaper but just as accurate option.",755,69,Tools,4.4,,4,0.0026

This does not seem like much but when you’re doing a side by side cabinet with a 6” bar handle the discrepancy was very apparent. I discarded and made a template from a plastic tool to finish all the cabinets. Also, the mechanic punch broke on the third hole. All things considered I got what I paid for.",119,37,Tools,4.4,,1,0.0004
2022-01-04,True,2,Out of the box the product would not assemble. It is made of aluminum so it was easy enough to use a file to widen the pieces or remove the blocking material. The ruler portion horizontally is steel but the rest of the components are plastic and aluminum. I thought all of the IKEA crap was metric but even this metric tool didn’t have a solid marker for the drawer handles I was trying to install. I made it work but I am not impressed with how it works. The screw down pins that hold the position of some of the adjustable components loosen too easily. The spring loaded punch tool will not execute through the tool as suggested. You have to mark the hole through the tool then remove the tool then use the spring loaded punch. Seems stupid.,119,37,Tools,4.4,,0,0.001
2022-07-08,True,2,I had high hopes for this jig but found when set exactly the adjustments for the holes could be as much as 1/4 off from each other (top to bottom) on big drawers. Too much room for error on custom cabinets. I reassembled the jig several times and it would never set straight or even on a cabinet door there was just too much play in it. By the time you do all the measurements to set the jig you’re two pencil marks away from installing the drawers pulls anyway. Would be handy for repeatability but not worth the risk in error to me.,119,37,Tools,4.4,,0,0.002
2023-06-19,True,3,"I like this as it did help me make holes where they needed to be, but I learned real fast that this is not accurate. For example I used the handles to line up the holes on the device , like I actually put screws though the holes into the handle, and then tightened it so I could use the included punch tool to mark where to drill.Well I drilled the first one where it was marked and it was off juust enough that I have to bore out the hold quite a bit on my new cabinets in order for it to line up. So what I did with the rest of them was I did the same thing but before I drilled I took the cabinet handles with the screws in the back and lined it up with where it told me to go, and gave it a good tap on the handle to make the marks in the correct spot. So this will do well in regards to the measurement in keeping them all centered and in the same place so it stayes uniform, BUT it will not give you 100% accuracy on where to punch the holes.",358,59,Tools,4.4,,2,0.0001
2022-03-06,True,3,"There’s a part on the piece that’s used to rest on the drawer that came assembled, it was put on backwards and thus prevented the ruler to slide through as it’s supposed to. I took apart, reassembled and works as expected.The metal material (ie rulers) seems to be pretty solid and think it’ll hold up well over time if you have a few dozen cabinets you want to install handles on. Thought it comes with metal fasteners to tighten the clips to the ruler, I could see them loosening up with a lot of usage. With that said, this was about $25 so not a big deal for the price. I installed cabinet pulls that were just over the 10” in length on 18” and 24” cabinet cabinet drawers. The hardware work ok on the 18” drawer but unfortunately the ruler isn’t long enough to have the center of it in the middle of my cabinet and the end clasp in a proper position “hold” position, I had to slide things over about 1/2”. In other words the hardware would be better if the horizontal ruler was longer. It still works though and a whole lot better using it than trying to do with a standard measuring tape.

Knowing it would require a few days I ordered my own as the price was not an issue. However, a warning... if you're a one-time user of this tool for a pull install project be very aware that even slight pressure on this tool when holding it AND drilling holes at the same time... WILL push the longer alignment unit away from its setting. This means your next hole is going to be where you do not want it and your pull will be out of alignment, crooked, or off-center. All the maker had to do is add a second set screw to the part as just the one is not adequate. This measurement check for every hole triples the time it takes to get your pulls installed. Also it does not accmodate wider drawers such as kitchen cookware drawers. For this I had to use a 36-inch ruler with a level built into it. Not bad for the price as long as you measure twice and drill once.",358,59,Tools,4.4,,0,0.0014

To get to the point.... the offset for the drill guide holes differ by 1/16"". (see pics). This may not sound like a lot but when you flip the jig over to drill the adjacent door, the combined error is a noticeable 1/8"" difference in the 2 holes directly across from each other. We are attempting to install 5"" long straight bar pulls (3"" hole spacing). After installing the first 2 pulls my kid walks into the kitchrn and immediately says ""hey those look crooked"". Because of the 1/8"" bust, the pull have a slight ""V"" thing going on. Ugh!

It does not work well when you want to install pulls on recessed panels of the drawers. And, it does not extend wide enough to use on most cabinets, so you end up having to hold it on a center mark... When I determined the measurements to line things up, I also realized that the rulers and the slide make no sense. There was no marking indicating where to look for the measurement... but then I used a tape measure and the measuremetns on the jig were not matching my tape measure. I could have installed all the pulls using a simple quick square and level in the time I spent messing with this junk.

2022-05-29,True,1,"We were so excited for this tool, as we have many long handles to install on cabinet doors. Unfortunately, after assembling the tool and placing it up against cabinet doors, it was very obvious that the tool was crooked. No amount of adjustment made it not crooked. I figured we could use the initial holes as a guide, mark them with a pencil, and then use straight edges and levels to get the second hole in alignment. Great idea, except the guide holes on this tool are not wide enough to insert a pencil through. So, in summation, this was a useless tool and we ended up having to measure everything anyway. Perhaps the other varieties of this tool are better (we bought the plastic one), but I can not recommend this for anything other than an exercise in frustration. We’re really glad the crookedness was obvious, so that at least we didn’t drill holes in our cabinets and the. Realize they weren’t aligned. Will be returning this item.",187,82,Tools,4.4,,1,0.1288

On a small handle 3 inch or single knob this might work, but once you get into the 4,5,6 inch pulls there is just too much variability causing them to not be level looking. The top plate that rests on the drawer shows up bowed and did not sit flat. I used the flat surface of a level and the top plate rocked back and forth. I had 16, 5 and 6 inch pulls to install and thought this would speed up the process, but after installing the first handle on the door and comparing it to the markings for the opposite door the locations of the holes didn't align. I ended up ditching the Jig and just measuring out my handles manually. It ended up being quicker then trying to adjust the Jig and then going back and measuring anyway to make sure it didn't get screwed up.

I prefer thinner packing cubes (think Eagle Creek, Amazon, etc. where you can roll a sweater or sweatshirt and it will fit very nicely in one row.

2023-06-25,True,5,"I make vegan artisanal cheeses and live in a city apartment so the 20L Cooluli cooler fit the size and look of the only space I had for a dedicated cheese grotto.  I haven’t ever seen anyone convert a thermoelectric cooler (rather than a refrigerator) to a cheese cave before, so I went into this knowing it’s a DIY modification.  And I’m delighted so far!First of all, the temperature holds fantastically.  I need my cheeses aged for a few months between 50-60 degrees.  I set the electronic thermostat to 55 and it’s holds between 53-55, depending on how often I open that little front door.  It’s a small space, so opening the door will affect the temp a degree or so pretty quickly.The thermostat is easy to use - LOVE simple computers!  I can hear when it’s actively cooling by the sound of the external fan and it rarely has to work - so:  far more energy efficient than a refrigerator with a compressor.  The external fan’s sound is what I consider quiet.  I have the set up in our solarium - not my bedroom:)When my young cheeses are shelved, the internal humidity goes up to 90% and I need it between 70-85% for long term aging, so I found a desiccant used for safes in the electronics section at London Drugs for $15.  Brings the humidity right down to 80% which is ideal for this purpose.  As the cheeses age, the humidity lowers a bit more.  Before I found the desiccant, I just collected those tiny desiccant pouches from supplement bottles, food bags and protein powder containers and those also work well - if you have enough of them!  Those can’t be reactivated in the oven though.  The former can.Because there is no internal fan in a thermoelectric cooler, I do wipe the floor and walls with a cloth twice a day to collect condensation.  Again, this is necessary to control the humidity.For air flow, I currently just rely on opening that little door two times / day when I affinage the cheese and wipe the humidity.  So far so good.  The cheeses are aging nicely.  If I want more air flow in the future, I would simply drill all the way through the wall next to where the door hinges are because there are no electrical components there and it’s just plastic.  I doubt I’ll need to do more than that (like install a small fan) because cheeses don’t want too much air flow - just enough to breathe.You can see for this purpose, I added a third ventilated shelf by drill-cutting holes in a plastic cutting board and using sticky electric cord clips (used in offices to try to keep your cords organized) down the side.  Perfection.Plus the cherry on top is this little 20L unit’s design is retro, attractive and matches my other solarium decor.  Would recommend!",1790,348,Kitchenware,4.3,,4,0.0

It has a thick black O-ring around the door for a seal, to me the door works just fine.  It's not child proof though, even a toddler could open it up.  These are pretty expensive units, the price has gone up significantly over the last few years, but they are worth it for sure.  The possible uses are insulin storage at 40F, keep your drinks cold in the mid 40s, keep hatching eggs at 60F, or even incubate chicken eggs at 99F.

Saved my insulin pens and even managed to save some food and furnish cold drinks.

2020-05-06,True,5,"I'm definitely a makeup/skincare junkie so of course I've seen and watched several reviews in the past on makeup fridges but just couldn't buy into the hype of shelling out a minimum of $100 for  a cute but tiny little 4l appliance where the reviews seemed to be split. The 20l Cooluli solved that problem.  I'm over the moon with my purchase.  First things first.  The manual states you can program it down to 16° but won't actually reach that low. I know it makes no sense to me either and upon my research guys that just seems to be the standard with most brands and models. Most of all the 4L, 8L, 10L, and 15L mini fridges usually don't go below 35°-37°f  (note that ambient temp of the room plays apart in that). Once I read this one goes to 30°f and boasted 20l of capacity, and didn't have an annoyingly loud fan hum noise, It was ano brainer. The fan in my pink 4l Frigidaire mini fridge that I got for $20 on Black Friday is louder than this. Also you can't tell in the picture on this site but the satin blue color option is almost metallic looking color and ties into my room decor perfectly. All for only an additional $49 and free shipping compared to those tiny tiny baby units.It features a magnetic closure so there's no bothersome latches or handles. Which equals less moving pieces to possibly break.  It Comes with a wall plug and ac adapter one for your car if you wish to bring it along on your travels. It does have a warmer built in which I guess is good for keeping warm food during those trips but I'll never use that feature.  The led display is bright enough to see but won't keep you up at night. So far the coolest temp I've seen it reach was 32°f. Mine is by my window which I don't recommend (remember the ambient temp thing) but I'm short on space. The led stays on and I haven't checked to see if can be turned off. They're two shelves in the main body that come attached but can be removed and the same goes for the 2 basket shelves on the inside of the door. I love the refreshing feel of my cold products being applied to my skin. What can you store? Well I also have in there some quartz stone face rollers, sheet mask, various toners, serums, moisturizer, gell mask, face oils, eye patches, sunscreens, primers and setting sprays. It looks high end, doesn't feel cheap, and does what it's suppose to do. If you're on the fence on this one bite the bullet. You're not going to to find a makeup fridge this stylish, spacious, that can get this cool, has a led display, and has warm a feature all under 150.00.**Update the lowest temp achieved so far is reading 27° f and there's a layer of ice on the inside wall of my unit (this unit doesn't gave a freezer.

I love being able to keep my pop, apples, yogurt and other items requiring refrigeration. Be aware, though, that some don't work as they should: the first replacement that I bought I returned because it didn't keep a cold enough temperature. I keep my room temperature under 70 degrees, yet it would only cool down to 45 degrees, and even then my room had to be really cold ( my room tends to get very warm, so I often open the window, even if just a crack, in the winter.)The new one cooled down to under 40 degrees in no time. If you buy one, just make sure it cools or heats up like it should.As far as looks go, it looks good. It has a good amount of space, with 2 shelves on the door as well as the two in the main area.

2019-05-18,True,5,"I originally started with the 4 liter mini-fridge, or more accurately, micro-fridge and was very pleased with it. I took it on long trips and would mainly put redbull in it (because on a long trip, who doesn’t love all the caffeine in the world) which would keep everything perfect while plugged into the car. I even love the heating feature which I used to heat water bottles up to use for a mini-shower when camping. The only issue with the 4 liter was I wanted more space. So, I decided to get the 20 liter. Just as pleased with the 20 liter as I was with the 4 liter. I live in a house with 5 other roommates so I needed to have a small fridge in my room and I decided to go with this instead of a mini-fridge you can get at in stores because I can just pack this up and take it with me wherever I go. It’s fantastic and holds what I need it to. I also was very impressed that the unit is able to go down to 15 degrees which I did not expect it to be able to do (good fridge for alcohol at that temperature). I do hear it at night every so often but it is by no means loud. It’s just a small hum that is only audible whenever it is absolutely silent in the room. I would recommend this fridge for people who would like a fridge that you are able to take with you to various places or travel a lot and still want a bit of room for a surprising amount of food and drinks. It also looks sleek which is a huge plus to me. I will say, even though I did know how much it would hold by comparison to my 4 liter, the pictures on the page do make it look slightly bigger than what it is; however, this isn’t anything that is a deal-breaker because it is able to hold quite the amount.I will give advice and say that if you are living in a dorm, I would recommend getting an actual mini-fridge as it is able to hold more and is comparable in price to this, but afterwards, I would say to get one of these if you needed a little more fridge space just due to the portability of the unit and also it has the dual function of being able to heat food as well (I don’t mean cook though because it maxes out at 149 degrees).The summary on the product is that although its biggest drawback is the size to price ratio (and I only say this because you can get bigger fridges for the same price), it makes up for it by having the versatility to be easily transported (which the size works to its advantage here) and it is able to function as a food warmer (which I first though was a neat gimmick but actually has a lot more uses than I had thought).",1790,348,Kitchenware,4.3,,68,0.0

We keep our room at 72F, and the fridge has no issues keeping the milk at 36F.It is also very quiet.

With that size honestly why would you even keep it there unless you were storing apples, or something for your kid. Barely any complaints.The size is good - Its what I was expectingThe storage is acceptable especially for its priceI can see myself using this in the future so that's a def winI haven't messed with the heating, but the temperature for insulation is pretty good.

I needed a semi small fridge to set on my night stand so I can eat during the day when my husband and kids are gone.PROs: This holds quite a bit and my family only needs to restock every 2-3 days. It also gets pretty cold. I put yogurts, small Gatorade bottles (I drink mostly water but due to drinking too much water,- I know strange problem to have, so I need electrolytes. Who knew drinking too much water could dehydrate you?) adult Lunchables, and a variety of fruit and cheeses, and premade sandwiches, etc. the space is awesome. The look is great. My ten-year-old unboxed it and set it up for me. So setup is definitely easy. You can hear the fan but it’s really not loud at all. I don’t notice it and it doesn’t affect my sleep. It was also fairly lightweight. So my daughter had no issues lifting it up to set on my nightstand.CONs:  This is the biggest issue and why I would not recommend purchasing. It shuts off at least once a day. And I never notice or catch it until I go to open it and see all my food is room temp now. This is frustrating and if I don’t catch it on time I’m worried the food has spoiled. Now if the fan was louder I might catch it sooner 😂This is honestly the only con I’ve found. But this is a major issue. It’s so frustrating having to constantly check. It also appears to me that the seal is not as good on the top as on the bottom.",170,67,Kitchenware,4.3,,26,0.0
2022-03-26,True,3,"It cools pretty well. Took a while to get down to 40 degrees fully loaded up (73 ambient). As much room as advertised.However, when placing it I first noticed the feet are just hollow plastic squares. If you fully load it up, it won't slide when you open it... but if its not that loaded, you'll have to use two hands if you want it to stay in place. Something grabby like rubber would have been nice. Maybe it was supposed to have inserts.The noise... honestly, a compressor mini fridge is probably quieter. It has the cheapest fans possible... something you'd expect from a 2005 dell PC or something. They make a very loud buzzing noise (not air flow). They are louder than my fish tank pumps and tank LED cooling fans. I hope they use standard fans so I can replace them with something quieter for $20-$30... but I shouldn't have to do that on a $150 product. Maybe I'll exchange it or contact the manufacturer first.Update: I was able to successfully replace the fans with Noctua 92mm fans (NF-A9 FLX) with the low noise adapter and a (separately purchased) 3 pin to 2 pin fan power adapter. Super quiet now, cools fine. The fans are standard 92x92x25 mm 12V fans with TWO PIN connectors. The only weird quirk is the board has a reversed polarity for the fan connectors.. I had to pull the pins out of the connector by pushing the tab on each and swap them. Fan mount is non-standard, but if you use the original screws it will hold fine. It was $50 to upgrade, but you can probably get reasonably quiet fans for $7-$10 each if you're willing to hunt for them. Noctua is pricy, but has a fantastic reputation.Wish they just spent the extra few bucks to put decent fans in originally.",170,67,Kitchenware,4.3,,14,0.0001

2022-07-19,True,3,"I do not recommend this mini fridge cooler, whatever you want to call it because it does not cool to the temperature it claims on Amazon. It relies on the ambient temperature to cool it. So what that means is if your room isn’t cold, the fridge isn’t cold. Mine will not go below 42 degrees and I like my soda very cold. I should have bought an actual mini fridge but they are expensive and too big for my bedroom. All I put in my fridge is diet soda and not many of them. I have an air conditioner window unit and a fan to keep my room cold in the summer, but when winter is here and I have the heat on, there is no guarantee it will stay at 42 degrees. What’s the point of a fridge that doesn’t get cold? Typical junk like everything else made today. Wish I had waited for Prime Day but I forgot about it.Addendum: so the fridge has worked better than initial because I had to turn the temperature down lower to 25 to get the temperature to stay roughly between 35 and 38 degrees. Now I shouldn’t have to do that but if it keeps the temperature of the fridge cold and it works, that’s alright with me.",170,67,Kitchenware,4.3,,10,0.0001
2021-10-24,True,3,Temperature control is not great on this product. It doesn’t stay at the temperature you set it at which is what I assumed when I bought it but bounces around to 3 degrees above or below the set temp and that’s when you don’t open the fridge at all. I bought this for insulin for my cat bc I was told my regular fridge was being opened too regularly which is why the temp bounced around so much and ended up making the insulin separate which than you can not use it so I decided to get this fridge bc it was recommended for medicine and insulin specifically. I am definitely a bit disappointed with that part but also with the fact that the back of the fridge on the inside keeps getting ice all over it and the temp is set at at 39 so I’m unsure why it keeps freezing like that. So now buying this fridge has made it almost more stressful than helpful bc now I still have to check the temp regularly on the fridge to make sure it hasn’t gotten too low or high and to check to make sure it’s not too icy and than if it is you have to unplug it to get it to dethaw and than the insulin is in jeopardy again and now I’m going to have to look for another solution and spend more money so value for money for me isn’t great,170,67,Kitchenware,4.3,,0,0.0001

Everything was perfect… until now.I woke up last week and noticed the temp was basically at room temperature (74 degrees). I figured, “okay, my room is decently hot, since we didn’t expect the hot weather to be this hot. Maybe it’s because of the heat?” We get the A/C turned on and the fridge  cools down to 69 (nice). Later that week, the fridge temp went back up to 74 degrees… which is the temp my room was at. Which brings me to right now. The unit has shut off entirely. No reboot has helped. I plugged it back in and nothing. This leads me to believe the unit was failing. Since having that unit, every summer it has cooled without fail, even when my room was too hot.I’m sad it’s dead.

Twice this has happened with the delivery and the food inside went bad. The power button should require a double-push or long-push. Overall it's a nice unit.",170,67,Kitchenware,4.3,,2,0.0044
2022-06-08,True,1,"I bought this on delivery because the bigger, cheaper mini fridges were too heavy for me to carry from the parcel locker to my apt. Therefore I opted to buy this fancier, albeit smaller, unit because it had adjustable temperature control, the option to keep food cold or warm, use it in a vehicle for travel or camping. It had a lot to offer for the price tag it carries. Or so I thought.When it arrived, they brought it straight to my door, I was thrilled. Packaging was well done. Came with the cables for using it in the car/camping/room.I set it up, it's been two days since I've had it and it won't go any colder than 37 degrees F on norm no matter what I set the temperature for. My room is cool/cold depending on the time of day because I live in Texas. The heat is triple digits during the summer, but my room is lovely.When I set up my drinks, I moved them from the full size refrigerator to my room where this is being kept, just for convenience. So they were already cold.The top shelf that it came with was very flimsy and bows easily. I put three can sodas on it and it collapses. Reached out to the manufacturer, June 6, 2022, followed their ridiculous need to supply them with extra information: batch number, purchase order number, a video uploaded to streamable.com like they wanted and emailed them all this information included the link to the video and they haven't responded. Their chat support is useless and utilizes Zendesk; they disabled the ability to send them attachments to make it easier for the customer to demonstrate their issue.I contacted them the day I got it and set it up. No response to my email despite them saying they would.I had previously filled out the limited warranty information that included all the information they requested. Having to use their website to communicate the issue, you'd think with my account signed in, all of that would be there when I referenced the unit I purchased, but no.So I DEDUCTED a star rating on this mini fridge for the fact the top shelf is flimsy and all I asked for was a replacement shelf; the display is supposed to turn off after two minutes of inactivity, but instead it remains on full brightness even days later. Despite the unit being quiet and not exuding too much heat, it did not come with a protective plastic over the door panel, which allowed it to be scuffed up while it was being packaged. Unit has magnetic doors, which removable door shelves. It can fit a good number of cans in it. But pricewise, this isn't a good investment.Stick to the known brands offering mini fridges/small fridges for $99 over this.Final Update: Jun 16, 2022  -- after spending 10 days going back and forth with Customer Service, having them refute my issues with the unit and declaring if I was going to keep it, then the best they can do was offer a 20% discount, I took it to avoid having to find a way to ship this unit back to them and pay for shipping twice.I paid $162.36 after tax and shipping to get this unit. I would have been better off buying local and somehow wrangling it home.Due to this experience, I've dropped the rating to one star because customer service, insurance availability, following through with Limited Warranty fulfillment, and the entire experience has turned me off from this company.I will not buy another of their products again. Extra insult to this entire fiasco, they refused to let me update this review with the video, taking it down. I had to find the original video in my deleted files, recover, and repeatedly attempt to add it to this review with an update of the entire process to date.TL:DR ISSUES?Display doesn't turn off after a few minutes as their manual states it will.CS says ""There's actually no option to manually turn off the LCD display of the unit"" in the same passage that says ""What happens was the unit that you have received maybe one of the batches of the unit that has the display that won't go off after a couple of minutes of inactivity"".Read that sentence and read the above. I copied them word for word from their customer service email. They do not address the fact this unit will not cool below 37 degrees F even in a super cold room.They will not address the flimsy shelf.Best they could do was 20% and 10 days of ignoring me, blameshifting, and finally that ""appeasement"" credit back to my payment method.Last Update June 16, 2022.",219,146,Kitchenware,4.3,,85,0.0056
2023-05-03,True,1,"I got this for some of my perfume collection that I wanted to keep in my room- the shelves are super flimsy and don’t handle weight like at all. The ‘indents’ on the back wall are barely passable as brackets for holding the shelves and if you get too much weight on them they slip out and fall, dropping everything. I’m not sure why they didn’t use the same brackets as the front… those held really well. Poor design & cheaply made for how expensive it is.I ended up being able to put only a few bottles on the top shelf… they couldn’t be lined up in the back or the shelf would fail; they couldn’t go too far forward or the door wouldn’t close; I had to keep them exactly in the middle, so most of the shelf was useless. Bottom level was the only actual usable space, but again I couldn’t fit too many inside or the door wouldn’t close w the baskets.Very tiny too, it just did not suit my needs at all. Most prob wouldn’t use it for perfume, but if you’re planning to, look elsewhere - I did like the digital temp control & set it @55 F - however I never tested it w my probe to see if it was accurate. I assume it would be a +/-  3-7 deg variation range (ie not accurate)It also didn’t work lol - I’d set the temp but within a few days everything inside would be room temp, it wasn’t cooling at all. I believe the readout would say 73 F but I can’t remember if I lowered the setting & it cooled again. And the fact that it changes the inner temp in relation to the ambient temp around it (by design) is just weird and makes it not really a functioning fridge?I had to leave town so I gave up on it but it was still leaking water all along the back wall which ended up ruining a few of my perfume bottles when I was gone bc it pooled at the bottom. I had been wiping it down every few days. So it ended up causing damage & was a complete failure.I don’t know what I was expecting. But for almost 150$ after tax? And that was on sale! I paid 135$ which is ridiculous. I ended up returning & getting an actual 1.6 cu ft mini drink fridge by Antarctic star for 180$… so 30$ more and I ended up w. a way bigger, better quality mini fridge, whisper quiet, cool looking, accurate and perfect for my needs :) even found some cubbies for the door & acrylic shelf toppers on the wire racks.",219,146,Kitchenware,4.3,,1,0.0

2021-06-02,True,1,"I started using this mini cooler on the first day and set it to 45F. I had this put in my bedroom because it's supposed to store my skincare products and water. After 5 hours of use, I had to turn it off because there was this annoying high-pitched frequency that was going on and off the whole time. I normally don't care about noise and am not easily bothered but the high-pitched noise was so irritating to my ears that it felt like I could go insane if I subjected myself to it any longer.

It worked fine during the winter and fall, but as soon as hot weather comes the temperature is impossible to keep under 45 degrees so the products inside are just lukewarm. During winter months the condensation at the bottom of the fridge would create puddles that would freeze. That didn't bother me so much as it was easy to clean but for this price having so many issues is just not worth it. It's a shame cause the product looks cute  and it fit well with my makeup desk but that means nothing if the product lacks quality and it's not safe (mine died in the middle of the night and I was woken up with with scary firecracker sound and smell coming from the unit).

Anyways, I woke up suddenly this morning to the smell of plastic burning, I looked around and finally realized it was coming from the refrigerator.

2020-05-01,True,2,"The Cooluli Concord is a typical peltier-based refrigerator. Well, maybe. I'm not 100% convinced there's a heat pump in this. But regardless, on to the actual review. This unit can chill well below ambient for a peltier-style cooler and even has a fairly slick design, all while being well below the cost of most refrigerators. But that's not to say there aren't issues. The unit does not seem to have a well insulated design. The front of the device is cold to the touch; meaning that the cool air within is definitely being dissipated outside. This is only one side of the device however, and the side that is usually less insulated than the rest, even on large expensive fridges. But with such a small footprint that could be causing it to lose out massively on efficiency and performance. Further, the devices thermostat seems less than stellar or accurate. It seems to have a few degrees of deviation. Now, that sounds terrible, but in all likelihood, it doesn't matter as it cannot usually go far enough below ambient for the thermostat to be useful other than to display the temperature. The interior is about as well laid out as it could be, the shelves are pathetically weak, but you'd be hard pressed to find something heavy enough to break them that could also fit in the fridge.Overall, the Concord does what it set out to do, and does it fairly well; it can cool it's 20 Liter capacity well below ambient temperature, does it rather quietly, and doesn't exhibit any major problems. All at a reasonable price.But the concord has serious and major flaws. It's insulation is lacking on the front door, it is a peltier system so cannot cool more than 20-30 degrees below ambient in even the best case, and the shelves are cheap. You should be prepared to deal with or work around these issues if you buy this product.Pros:1. Cheap for the performance, and overall feels well-made.2. Can get well below ambient, performing well for this type of cooler/frige.3. Low profile in noise and size.Cons:1. It's still cheap feeling in many places. It's obviously plastic on the sides, and not in a good way, and the shelves are crap.2. It cannot reach your specified temperature if it is significantly below ambient. You can't use this to keep your beer cold in the desert. It just can't do it. 20-30 degrees below ambient in the best case, remember that.3. The front door seems to be lacking insulation. This would normally not be a problem if con #2 didn't exist. This could likely be giving up an extra few degrees of performance.It's electrical usage is not particularly notable. Not a lot, but not significantly less than anything else in its price class. 80W is what it is specified for. I'd personally like to see them offer a double wattage variant, or switch, that provided more cooling.Edit:It's now a couple years later, and the fridge has committed self-die in some ways. The fans are glued on, and not easy to repair for no good reason. I'm reducing my star rating drastically because that makes this fridge essentially doomed to a landfill for most people. Why use glue? It's just not necessary. The fans also have frankly disgustingly cheap bearings. They will become absurdly loud in no time.",97,66,Kitchenware,4.3,,7,0.0001
2023-06-06,True,2,"My initial review was 5 star, but NOW 3 weeks later, it is closer to a 1-2 star rating unfortunately. My son needed a storage solution for injectable medication that has to be kept at a certain temperature range as his fridge in his apartment was temperamental (either too freezing or too warm). He loved this mini fridge the first 2 weeks, as it kept the meds within the required temperature range for better storage and longer lasting efficacy. HOWEVER now it is building ice, nearly freezing his medications even though he has it set to 42 degrees. The medication is very expensive, so we thought investing in this fridge would be a great idea, seeing how many positive reviews there were.

2019-07-31,True,2,"I use this to store my butters and oils for bath products. They need to stay cool.  Whats important to know is that interior temperature varies based on the room temperature.  So in a room that is NOT airconditioned  the temp will not stay as cool as I would like. Example- the room temp got up to 92f and the temp inside the unit rose to 54f, even though it was set for the lowest temp it could go.  I liked the small size, I didn't want to purchase a regular refrigerator because of space limitations.  It's not whisper quiet, but because no one sleeps in that room I don't worry about it. I might move it to a different room temporarily and see how that works. ********Review Update*********  I moved the unit to a different (cooler) room & that helped a little.  Here's the issue I am having now-  there is a lot of condensation in the unit. There is a layer of ice on the bottom and frost accumulating on the inside back of the unit  I called customer service and was told that they recommend turning off the unit, emptying it and let it come to room temp, and then wiping it down once or twice a week!  Definitely not what I signed up for, and very inconvenient.  I didn't want to get a regular ""cube"" refrigerator, but now I think that would've been a better choice for me.

I originally bought this for road trips, but I didn't want to take the chance on killing my vehicle battery if I forgot to disconnect it when I turned the car off.  It was so cute that I decided to keep it.  I decided to keep it and put it in one of our bedrooms since we sometimes need some cold water in the middle of the night.  My kids fought over who would get it in their room.  So far, we love it.  I even considered swapping out my mini fridge at work, which is bigger, for this one.  It keeps drinks nice and cold.The only caution I'd have is to put something waterproof under it, because it defrosted, and the water leaked on our dresser and caused puckering on the dresser.June 5, 2022 Update:This stopped working after having it a little over two years. Also, you need to place something waterproof under it to prevent water damage if you have it sitting on a certain types of surfaces.

2023-06-29,True,4,"What I LOVE about this thing is simple_  IT WORKS!  Well, it works GREAT as long as the room's temperature is say below 80°f.  Yup, that's right.  IF your ambient temperature is around say 68°f to about 74°f, you CAN keep the temperature somewhere around 40°f to 42°f.  So this thing WAS working GREAT while the weather was cooler than now.  It's now around 75 to 80°f outside, and up on the third floor, where this device lives, it gets to over 80°f.  The ONLY air conditioning is in my bedroom, across from the room the device is being used in.  There is little to no room in the bedroom to place the device or I would.  Anyway, once the room temperature where the device is located gets past 76°f or higher, you are likely to start seeing temps close to 50°f inside the device, which is not ideal for keeping foods SAFE, according to what you are told if asking WHAT IS CONSIDDERED A SAFE TEMP. FOR FOOD REFRIGERATION?  You should try keeping the temperature at or below about 40°f, but I personally feel it's 'okay' up to about 46°f.  But that's just me.All of the above makes sense when you consider the information about the device DOES tell us the thing will keep the temp 30-to-35°f BELOW AMBIENT ROOM TEMP.  So, 85°f minus 35°f will result in about 50°f.I can't stress strongly enough how GREAT this thing actually is.  I just need to get a REAL refrigerator that uses a ""refrigerant"" that will keep the cool going, and possibly included a small little freezer!  :-)I will be putting the reimbursement towards just that, which I have already narrowed it down to THREE.I HIGHLY recommend this for travel in the car or such, especially if you would rather use the thing for keeping food or soups HOT!

I'm glad it has a digital display so I can SEE that it is on! It's THAT quiet!My two criticisms are:- The seal is pretty nonexistent. The door closes just fine, but it can be bumped open with the slightest nudge. It would be GREAT if it came with a door lock of some sort. I've purchased a couple of ""child"" locks, but the width of the door is too narrow to accommodate the lock without it extending beyond the margins of the door width- I wish there was a ""controls lock"" that helped prevent the settings from being changed, or the unit turned off so easily. If I open the fridge by grabbing the top of the door, I find that I accidentally hit the power button and inadvertently turn off the fridge.This unit is quiet, cute, just the right size for my needs, modern, and works like a charm.

After my initial disappointment in the color, I did some research and couldn’t find anything comparable to the small size and temperature control offered by this model. I decided to test it and see if it’s worth repurchasing and just hoping for a white one (like some lucky reviewers seem to get). After starting it up, it’s not super loud, but the noise would be annoying if I put the fridge directly next to my nursing chair. I moved it into the closet where it would be less noticeable. Id compare the noise level to someone humming. Behind the closet door, I can barely hear it. It’s down to 32 degrees on the display and has my water super cold but not frozen. We have some hot days coming up next week so that will be the real test. I need it to keep breast milk at 40 degrees or below and so far so good.Original review: The white doesn’t look like the product image at all.

There is a 5 degree temperature DIFFRENCE between the top shelf and the bottom floor of the unit. I use this product to keep my pig genetics (sperm) at a constant very important temperature for up to 10 days. That being said 5 degrees difference from the top shelf to the bottom shelf Which is less than 2 ft is very important and critical to me. That's the difference between Pig genetics lasting 10 days or only lasting 4 to 5.I'm sure if the intended use which is for wine and beverages this is not a big issue. I am a DIY kind of person and I find things that work and also fit my budget. The four 4 star review for the overall unit is because I have only used the unit 2 days I will have to see how this unit performs 8 months and 12 months or years later. Will update if I can through Amazon website. Hope this is helpful.

2021-06-16,True,5,"I’m 5’8” and wear a size 16/18 per reviews and the sizing chart I went with an XL .. it fits and it’s cute ... but being tall and having a large chest if I wanted more of the fit in the photo of the dress I would have sized up to an xxl ... it is incredibly light weight. You want to wear this when it’s 95 and humid for sure.  But not so light it’s see through .. I’m wearing dark underwear, not at all visible.  The fabric is a bit on the clingy side you can totally see my back fat.. I’m good with the length I don’t mind a little short.I’m 250lbs give or take depending on the day  since I guess that matters? But I’m super solid and muscular beneath the pudge and I’ve lost a lot of weight so I hold extra in weird places ... so I’d say this would normally fit similarly on someone in the 190-220 range who has fairly evenly dispersed body weight at 5’8”FYI I actually like the way it fits and shows off my curves just enough while still being flowy at the bottom",8548,1299,Womenwear,4.3,,70,0.0
2023-06-02,True,5,"UPDATE: still love this dress. My Boyfriend accidentally put it in with donations so i no longer had it. I loved the dress so much that i actually repurchased it.Original review: This is the cool, comfortable, yet stylish dress I needed for summer. It's not too low cut in the arms or neckline and the above the knee length was perfect. The fabric is cool and stretches. It isn't transparent. I did not end up needing to wear a slip or cami to feel presentable in it which, in terms of hot weather comfort, is huge. I would buy it again.",8548,1299,Womenwear,4.3,,3,0.0058
2022-07-26,True,5,"I own two of these and love them. More below, but the only drawback is that they are NOT quick drying. Instructions say not to put them in the dryer, but I dry them on medium and take them out while they are still a bit damp. Works fine. No noticeable shrinkage. Line drying them takes forever. Back to the good stuff. I just came back from two weeks at a beach resort. I wore this dress to dinner. I threw it on to hang our wet swim gear on the outside lines or to run quick errands around the resort. I lay around in it in the afternoons. Never slept in it, but you certainly could. I didn't wear it over my wet swimsuit though, because of the slow drying mentioned above. The fabric on the two I have is super soft; they drape very nicely for a flattering silhouette. Pack well ... wrinkles hang right out. When I got the first one, I was a little worried that it would be hot, because the fabric is fairly substantial, but they are nice and cool despite that. I wear them all the time at home too. In fact, you know what? I think I'll buy another one. Can't have too many!",8548,1299,Womenwear,4.3,,8,0.0002
2023-04-23,True,5,"I rarely write reviews, but after years of searching for a simple, lightweight, comfortable sundress I can live in, I felt compelled to do so. I am in LOVE with this dress!  (I ordered the navy blue with the understated solid white flower design). I am 5'7 and 158lbs (Well I just had my 2nd major surgery in a year so probably more like 168lbs) I am not in shape by any means due to impingement/labral tears in my hip joints. Hence the surgeries. I am in my early 40s and have a lot of extra skin around my hips and belly that make me self-conscious. So I like a looser fit and ordered an XL. It's perfect. I will definitely order more.

2022-07-02,True,5,"They fit true to size and they hang so gracefully. I'm 5'5, 138lb. I got a medium. It fits smooth over the breast and under the arms.(no bagging). Then falls looser through the middle and covers belly area just great. Then flows out nicely with a wider flare at the hip. If all that makes since! They make you look as though your shapely in it. Who wouldn't like that. They are all 3 just beautiful in the colors. the sky blue is really beautiful. Go for the lighter colors, they are very pretty on. You'll be glad you did. I sure was. I also got the grey which is better than always getting black. It's a pretty color too. Also I got the coral which is just beautiful. The material is super soft knit. It's like a tee shirt. Wearing a cardigan with them also looks cute. They land just a bit above the knee. I find that a great length. It looks nice with sneakers. To long at the knee doesn't. I like the look of just above knee than I go to midi. Look the best with sneakers for me. They really are pretty dresses. FYI, I sprayed them with warm water, (to get the wrinkles out), and hung them to dry before I tried them on. I can't get a good feel for something when it looks crappy to start with. They also wash nicely (turn inside out and they don't pill as quickly.) The pockets don't hang bulky either. That feature was a plus for me. Otherwise I would have cut them out and sewn it closed which I've had to do from time to time. Pockets can be hippy looking, if you know what I mean.

2023-05-18,True,4,I only wore the swimsuit top because I already had a suit bottom so I’m not sure how the shorts fit but the top was great! I wore it to play in the ocean and I think maybe the suit is meant more for a pool because it kept puffing up in the chest and would ride up some but I don’t like things that fit too tight so I didn’t mind too much. Even playing in waves all week the suit only had to be adjusted once so it stays in place pretty well. Was a pretty green color and even with salt and a couple washings it doesn’t look like it’s wearing out any.,682,78,Womenwear,4.5,,5,0.0008
2022-07-12,True,4,"Finally received the swimsuit after it took a week to finally get it. Slow shipping. The swimsuit is light and comfy and flattering. Only thing is that the bralette part does not come off as they said. It is attached. Wish you could take it off. Wish the bottoms were a little longer. All and all I am satisfied.For some reason it won’t bring up the green swimsuit, it brings up my previous black swimsuit I ordered. On the green swimsuit with palm tree bottoms I give it a two star. Debating on sending this back. It came in a ripped bag and it is so wrinkled. It was stuffed in this little ripped bag. Not sure if this is a return from someone else or the owner shoved it in like this. To me it looks like a customer returned this swimsuit in a careless manner but all and all it’s up to the owner to fold this nicely in a new bag not a used bag. I feel like this is a used swimsuit not a new swimsuit. Very disappointed!On the flamingo swimsuit i give it a 2 star. The top should be navy blue not royal blue. The bottoms are slightly shorter and pull tight when walking like they are stitched wrong not as comfortable as my other bottoms on other swimsuits.",682,78,Womenwear,4.5,,1,0.0001
2023-07-11,True,5,These bathing suits offer everything I look for and I’m a tough customer. I hate the way I look in any suit. I don’t need anti depressants when I see myself in the mirror with these lolI also need comfort. It’s the most important thing for me. Most suits either pull or dig in somewhere but these don’t at all. The top and bottom are both super comfortable with a great fit. The straps on the top are wide and adjustable and it hides my stomach completely but without making me look fat. The bottoms are the perfect length and the lining in the crotch doesn’t bunch up. I love that the tops are plain black so they match all my bottoms. The quality feels really nice too. Absolutely perfect bathing suitsThe Dino’s are my favorite they are adorableI’m 5’6 140lbs and I got a large.

The legs although I work out on the treadmill 6 out of 7 days I just have thick legs and these short make them look amazing! I couldn’t be more please with the comfort and fit.

2023-02-23,True,5,"This was a nice suit for the money and I wore it quite a bit on our recent cruise.  I do have a bit of a belly and I found the bottoms tended to roll a bit because of it, so I had to keep readjusting.  I also found the neckline a little more blousy when snorkeling than I'd like.  Next time, Id probably go for a suit that fits more like mom jeans and a tighter bust line, but it was still a nice suit.

It was just very A-line and had a lot of material to it so it made me look a lot larger than I am.  I also like my cover-ups a bit shorter and this went almost to my knees.

This is definitely a loose coverup), and it was light weight so I wasn't too hot in the Jamaica heat.Bonus! It is hard to dry clothes in JA, however this item dried easily hanging in the closet of our room, this was great since I was in and out of it with a wet/damp bathingsuit all week!Overall, a great piece and easy to roll up and stick in a carry on luggage or checked baggage, or beach bag for the day!",967,144,Womenwear,4.0,,8,0.0006

It is not super long/short - hits above my knees but below my fingertips.  The medium was too loose in the bust (I'm 36C) / shoulders and looked more frumpy. The small was more fitted in that area but still plenty loose, not snug or fitted at all, just enough to show that I have a little shape.  It is a full A from there so it's going to be flowy on the bottom, which I personally like.  Sizing down made it like a cute summer dress/coverup vs a moo moo feel for me personally.

Both dresses are mediums but they are completely different sizes. The white one had a shoulder pad and a seam to bring the shoulders in a bit, but the yellow did not. The white one had curvature the yellow did not. The white one, chest was less inches across from shoulder to shoulder. The yellow dress was 3.5 inches wider across the chest. As you can see in the picture, the yellow dress is sagging in the front whereas the white one isn’t. It’s supposed to be the same dress, it’s supposed to be the same size, they both say medium but the yellow one is definitely a large or an extra large.

I hope to either exchange it for other color or just return it, since there are many other cons that outweighs its pros.Pros: elegant design but too revealing. If you wanna use it for anything other than work, I guess it will look fine.Material: stretchy to about half a inch or so and is soft.Buttons: looks good, they do not look cheap.Cons:See through: As I said I bought white, and it’s see through, I cannot wear it at workToo revealing: also the neck is too big. In America, women don’t wear this big neck at work, we are ethically required to wear professional outfits that are not revealing.Too large: bodycon dresses are supposed to be about a knee length, this dress is way too longUnnecessary pads on shoulder: those pads looks too unnecessary, and doesn’t go with the dress style.",889,148,Womenwear,4.0,,3,0.0

There is lots of clevage and held up ok, but under the breast rolls some.  Was a tad bit lose , but i could live with it since it hooks and ties around the back.

I just purchased the winered set and it is cheaply made, super thin, and doesn't even have the same stitching as the coffee set. The bra pads aren't even inserts like the description says. They are not comparable AT ALL but have the same product description and measurements but they are NOT THE SAME. I don't know if they have a new manufacturer or what but I will definitely be returning. I am very disappointed because I have bought several different colors of this set in the past year and they were all great but this seems  like they sent me something from a completely different company.

The material does have some stretch and is soft, but it doesn't make up for these other issues. Also, I am typically always a Medium and the top is barely long enough to cover anything and the waistband of the pants is so small I would have thought I ordered an XS.

It has removable padding in the top which was a feature I liked. The top fits like a sports bra. It is not see through as far as I can tell; but, that may be because I ordered it in Black. It's a thicker fabric than most athletic wear that I have but I prefer that over see-through issues.The two cons I have found:1) I have noticed, over the time I've had it, the tightness and security of the top has been lessening over time. I might need to throw a sports bra on under it (which, I honestly thought I would have to do initially because that's what I have to do with most work out tops).2) When I do my spin classes, the bottom part of the shorts slide/roll up a little bit.I think if you get this item on sale, it is definitely worth it.

The top is too small in the breast area despite being the correct measurements on the listing and the shoulders are wide set so the straps fall off my shoulders. The bottoms fit great. My second issue: I ordered this in GREEN and it is more of a blue-green/teal color. Please be aware that the color bled BAD and ruined several items of clothing that it was washed with.

The shorts also don't have a seam on the sides or down the middle backside. I like the appearance of the stitching so it draws the eye up and down my figure, so that is a negative for me. The top could probably be matched with a bottom that's better suited for the gym. I would have returned the set, but I hate making returns so I will use this for lounging and casual wear.

And second, the top is very cute but I do find the straps to be a little too far a part on me with the square neckline as I have to keep adjusting them when I workout to not fall off my shoulders.

The shorts are a little tight, but my thighs are a little thick, especially since I am lifting. They hug my thighs and makes me seem as if they are too small.

It’s not terrible, but I do find myself repeatedly pulling them up. These are heavy and not at all see through. I tried bending and squatting in bright sunlight, and my husband said that nothing shows through. These smelled bad when they arrived. It wasn’t really a chemical smell, but something akin to a faint vomit smell. Gross. One wash fixed that, and they washed up nicely. They are soft and comfortable and quite warm.

It's a polyester fabric, which lays nicely, but isn't a great quality. It doesn't look like a high-end dress. It looks like a $50 dress.-The back elastic makes the dress look even cheaper. I don't love it.

The large was easy enough to get on and off but it was a bit big on me at the top. I managed to get the medium on and it cut around my waist much better and wasn't as loose around the top. I would have to get it hemmed regardless which isn't surprising for me anywayI wish they would add a zipper because I think that would open more doors for customers to get a better fit without having to wriggle through it.Overall I decided not to go with this dress because it just didn't look that flattering on me but it's definitely comfortable and for anyone on the fence I'd say give it a shot.,653,197,Womenwear,4.0,,7,0.0005

The new dress in 2022 has a different less stretchy material, but it's still has some give, and the underbust line is much less elastic. I tried to illustrate in the images attached how the light gray version shrinks up so much more on the elasticity in comparison to the darker gray at that underbust line. I would guesstimate stretching it between two hands the lt gray version expands out 4 inches more. However no issue - still like it- it's just a little tight getting over the bust but doesn't cut in.

While the dress is fairly opaque, if the dress is stretched out a bit you are able see through it, but it wouldn't be as apparent in darker colors. I would only find this to be an issue if your body is going to stretch out the dress significantly.

2021-07-05,False,3,"I don't mind fiber like psyllium that takes on a thick, rather slimey or lumpy texture because it fills me up and makes me feel like I'm actually eating something as opposed to manufactured fibers that are designed to dissolve completely or become ""invisible"" (these type of fibers aren't that stellar btw). This product is definitely in the first category so if you really can't handle thick fibers, you may want to pass on this product. This will be thick, slippery, and lumpy when mixed in cold water.This is mainly psyllium but includes four other sources of fiber, one of which is corn-based digestive resistant maltodextrin (Fibersol-2), so not all the fibers in this are necessary or that great. You could stick with just psyllium and get the same or more health benefits with less processing.This includes natural flavors which can include over 600 undisclosed chemicals and allergens. This is sweetened with stevia and doesn't include any coloring agents. While the ingredients boast of 4 different probiotic strains, the amount and potency is not listed anywhere on the tub so I doubt there's enough probiotics in this to do diddlysquat for you. (Numerous companies will add the word ""probiotics"" to their label to lure in people but 90% of the time, the CFU count or strain variety is not enough to make a difference or merit a higher price.)While the ingredients aren't bad overall, they're not the simplest or most pure either.Flavor:I got this in coconut lime, a flavor I'm not generally keen on because it usually tastes artificial, like fake coconut mixed with citrus-scented toilet cleaner. This is exactly that: slightly try-hard coconut flavor overpowered by lime household cleaner scent. If you like coconut lime things, though, you may love this. It's the perfect level of sweetness at least. The stevia is just right imo, making this easier to get down and almost enjoy.There is an ever so slight bitterness that doesn't stem from the stevia (I am extremely familiar with stevia aftertaste, etc) and I can tell you almost 100% confidently that it's the psyllium and oat or chia just starting to go rancid. Believe it or not, psyllium does go rancid and as it does, a very distinct and specific bitterness starts to develop. Same goes for chia and oat, even more so due to these containing trace amounts of fats.",13,4,Health Supplements,3.9,,3,0.0001
2021-06-03,False,3,"What I like about this fiber:+ It has a blend of different fibers all with their unique benefits+ Added probiotics to improve gut health overallWhat I didn't like:- Very artificial tasting mildly of coconut and lime- Strong stevia aftertasteThis fiber supplement has a lot going for it. It has a variety of fibers each with their unique benefits. Chia seeds provides omega-3, oat fiber that is beneficial for heart health, the prebiotic fiber inulin, and psyllium husk for the bulk of the fiber. There are also probiotics to improve overall gut health. With all this going for it, I was disappointed to find that I really didn't like the taste. The coconut lime flavor is very artificial tasting and not appealing at all. There is a strong stevia aftertaste that lingers in the mouth well after I've finished the drink. I can't say anything about the consistency since I've learned early on that I do not like the texture of psyllium husk drinks so I pretty much try to finish the cup in under a minute before it has a chance to thicken.Overall there are other better tasting fibers out there with my favorites being sweetened using SweetenFX that doesn't leave any sweetener aftertaste. I'm going to try to finish this fiber because it has a lot of good things in it but the flavor is just not my favorite.Review For:nbpure All-Natural Daily Multi-Fiber, Premium Fiber Supplement with Prebiotics, Probiotics, Coconut Lime Flavor, 360 Grams",13,4,Health Supplements,3.9,,0,0.0003

It is a nice change up from the fiber powders I am used to.

2021-07-19,False,4,"I regularly use psyllium husk powder, and I know that a lot of people don’t like to use it because of how thick and gloopy it gets. What I do is actually prepare a drink the night before. I add the fiber powder as well as some other things to either coconut water or tomato juice (both high in potassium). Every powder that I add gets well hydrated. The amount of liquid that I use is a lot more than what you’d mix this into if you were just going to drink this. The end result is that my drink isn’t unpleasantly thick and sludgy. Doing as I do, you don’t need a fiber powder that is flavored because it’s being added to something that’s already flavored. However, if it does have a flavor and that flavor is good, I would consider drinking it on its own if I felt like I needed more fiber on any particular day.Unfortunately for me, I think the flavor of this is not good at all. Granted, I don’t like the flavor of coconut, but I do like the flavor of lime, so I was hoping that it would taste a lot more like lime. I’m not really sure what this tastes like. There’s coconut and there’s lime, but I feel as though there’s something else going on, but I don’t know. Maybe it’s the stevia, which is one sweetener that I do not care for.  Fortunately for me, the flavor is not a problem if I just add it to something else that’s already flavored.If you like the flavor and you’re just adding this to some water, maybe it’s worth the expense. However, I would be better off with something else that’s cheaper. I doubt the probiotics are doing much given that no real details are provided.Unlike pure psyllium husk powder, this is a blend that includes multiple fiber sources. It has a decent amount of fiber listed, but it’s not more than just psyllium husk powder. I don’t know if there is any actual benefit to having this particular blend of fibers considering that there is no mention of any vitamins or minerals – just carbs and fiber, not even any protein.",24,9,Health Supplements,3.9,,0,0.0005

Fiber not only digests more slowly than many other foods and keeps you full longer, but it also helps you maintain normal bowel movements and reduce constipation.""According to Healthline, probiotics aid digestion by""lowering the pH level in the colon, which might help stool move faster through the colon. Probiotics may relieve antibiotic-related diarrhea. Probiotics may be especially helpful in relieving diarrhea associated with antibiotics and Clostridium difficile.""If you have IBS, I hope you understand the benefits of a high fiber diet. With IBS, whether it's with diarrhea or constipation, you really need to consume more fiber than the average person every single day without fail and it needs to be good, high quality soluble fiber. Physicians recommend patients with IBS increase their intake of dietary fiber to 30–35 grams daily in order to regulate the stools and reduce abdominal pain.  Psyllium husk fiber has been shown to be  a good bulking fiber. It's considered the “go to” fiber source for IBS. Another highly beneficial fiber food is chia seed which can easily be consumed in liquids and soups. Be sure to consume adequate liquids with all fiber supplements so you don't cause blockages.These are all great reasons to use this high fiber supplement.

I know many include a sweetener, but jeez why so sweet? It has to be consumed quickly, so it isn't like I can reduce the flavor by adding a lot more water. I usually dont add stuff like this to my smoothies. It needs to be worked in really well otherwise it turns gelatinous. I tend to sip my smoothies rather than chug them so I just keep psyllium based products out of my smoothies and take it as a quick supplement instead.

2023-07-06,True,4,"So far I’ve been loving this product, for several reasons (i’ll go over the main ones). One, it helps with digestion & the fiber helps you “go” at a reasonable rate. Two, it gives me this energy boost every morning to get my day started and now I don’t do my morning routine without it. Three, it’s easy to mix into any liquid as long as the flavor doesn’t interact negatively with it. Also, I’ve been noticing improvements with my skin, possibly due to me getting a nice serving of superfoods every morning. But with the positives there are also negatives unfortunately. The taste of the mango flavor is very stevia-like which can sometimes be hard to digest early in the morning. But based on other reviews I’ve seen it seems like the berry one has the best flavor, so I’ll try that one out next time. Also, if you mix this with other supplement powders like collagen or protein, it will clump up and be hard to drink. So it’s better to drink it on its own. Lastly, the price is quite steep for me as I am a college student. The powder has really been helpful, but it’s hard to think that i’d have to drop ~$40 a month to continue enjoying this.

I've noticed that my hair grows more quickly, my nails are stronger, and my skin looks more radiant. I figure that's from the ""beauty complex"" and other nutrients that I was most likely lacking. I used to take AG1 every day and switched to Bloom due to the much lower price and if I'm being completely honest, I've seen more results from Bloom. Don't waste your money on the more expensive supplements. Nothing OTC can truly fix your gut problems. That takes time, doctor visits, as well as trial and error with food.

2023-06-29,True,4,"I’m almost 50 and struggle with random bloating. I researched supplements and found this was highly rated (then my niece told me it is “all over Tik Tok “ 🤷‍♀️!). I’ve been drinking a glass or half a glass everyday for almost 2 weeks. I can’t say it’s doing much for my bloating yet but I’ll give it more time. I do really like the taste and I’m only a water, coffee or wine drinker.  I don’t drink juices or soda. I think this is light and crisp. I got the variety pack of pouches so I could try coconut, berry and mango. I’d say coconut is my favorite but they are all good. The trick I found is to use a small blender like a magic bullet. Even if you’re just doing the powder and water. The powder can be very gritty if not VERY well blended. I add water, about 4 frozen slices of banana, sometimes an ice cube or two, sometimes a chunk of frozen mango. It’s really good any way I make it as long as it’s blended.",5659,1362,Health Supplements,4.3,,9,0.0001
2023-08-01,True,4,I’ve been using these for about a month and a half I had the mango one at first and thought it was good until I have the citrus. It’s way more light and refreshing. I find putting the powder in and then the water makes it easier to shake up. You will want to mix with each drink. I do 12 Oz of water but you can do 8. I noticed the gut health right away I don’t notice my energy but I think the gut health goes in hand. Glad I gave this flavor a try because I was going to switch brands but I will definitely keep buying this.,5659,1362,Health Supplements,4.3,,2,0.0015
2023-07-23,True,4,"Bloom reached out for me to try their product. I bought the mixed berry flavor. The taste was great even with just water and it added a nice boost to my smoothies. This a good product to just give your days a lil tiny push of health. I do wish they had a full nutritional breakdown of the vitamins and minerals DV so you could get a clearer picture of what this supplement is boosting. I will say, the serving size is a bit minuscule if you really want it to pack a punch, this has to be taken multiple times a day. My nutritionist said she was okay with Bloom but it’s more of a cherry on top of the sundae rather a big boost",5659,1362,Health Supplements,4.3,,6,0.0009
2023-07-19,True,4,"I have to admit: I'm not really a fan of green juice. I was pleasantly surprised by this blend, though. It tastes like fruit juice (I got the mango flavor, which actually tastes like mango), and it's sweet even though it doesn't have added sugar. The powder does settle a bit after a few minutes, but even though I could see it separated, it didn't taste gritty at all (I should note also that I just stirred it rather than using an immersion blender or something). Plus, I love all the extra fruit, veggies, fiber, and probiotics it provides--it's a lot of nutrients and very tasty for few calories and no extra sugar.

It tastes so good (I was surprised). I ordered the citrus flavor since I looked on internet and everybody was saying that was the best one. Just the right amount of sweetness. The only problem is the price, I know not everyone would be able to spend that amount of money for one month.

2023-07-26,True,2,"I wanted to love this based on the reviews and testimonials of helping with digestion and bloating. I tried Mango first - the taste was ok, but had to drink with a straw because I didn't like the smell as I sipped. It doesn't mix great and stays a little grainy. I struggled to finish one serving and had a headache almost immediately after. I used the Help Chat bot to request/receive a refund for this item. While I was waiting for Mango to arrive, there was a major discount, so I ordered Citrus too. I decided to give it a try to see if the Mango was just an anomaly...Nope. I tried the Citrus 3 times. It tastes better and didn't have the same dirt/grass smell while I was drinking it (mixed with V8 splash/water and blended with frozen fruit), but I determine the headache issue persisted with the Citrus version as well. Luckily, it was pretty easy to get a refund. Proceed with caution -  I didn't see reviews about headaches prior to experiencing this side effect, then saw a number of reviewers experienced the same. Might work for some, but I am not willing to ""push through"" more headaches to see if my body ""adjusts.""",1547,386,Health Supplements,4.3,,0,0.0004

I was running low when it was prime day so decided to order off Amazon instead of from the bloom website. My greens from Amazon came while I still had a couple days left of my last container and the color is not the same nor is the texture. I have now been using the greens I purchased off Amazon and I feel more bloated and am more gassy then I have been in a very long time. I ordered more greens from their website and will be throwing away the Amazon ones once they arrive!,1547,386,Health Supplements,4.3,,1,0.0025

I wouldn't say it's the worst thing I've tried  but honestly you may just be better off with smoothies and green juice.Tastes nothing like mango, more like vanilla pea protein. Has a sweet taste but it's very synthetic in my opinion. Weird smell I can't describe but definitely doesn't smell like greens.Can't say that I was any less bloated than usual or if my gut movement was any better while using it, didn't notice too much of a difference myself but ultimately had to stop drinking it anyway because of the taste. I used both my handheld milk frother and also tried just sticking it in a water bottle and shaking it and the texture was the same both times. Tried to get pictures to display it, impossible. Very grainy and separated after maybe a minute, you can sort of see it in one of my photos, so if this bothers you this is your warning.Probably won't be buying this again, I was excited to try it and it did not live up to the hype.",1547,386,Health Supplements,4.3,,5,0.0001

I tried to keep a similar diet to what I was eating before and there was no change in my gut health/bloating. However when combining it with eating healthier whole foods, I found there to be a change, but it was likely not because of the greens juice. Overall the macros for this powder makes it not worth it and has motivated me to make my own greens juice because of how disappointed I was with this product.

While doing my hair, I noticed a massive amount of extra shedding. Looking at a previous review, someone else had a massive amount of shedding. I have completely stopped using this in my daily routine so be aware, it looks like it might be something that happens to some people.That person said that after they stop drinking it and everything went back to normal.

It looks the same as in these pictures but dear God it tastes awful or at least the Citrus flavor that I purchased. I managed to drink this for two days but decided to stop because it made me feel extremely nauseous. The first time I tried it I almost puked, and my stomach was really upset after. The second day was even worse, unlike the first day where I was feeling nauseous for only a couple of hours, this time I felt it for most of my work day. I had this powder with water around 10 am and felt nauseous until the end of the workday and it significantly affected my productivity that day. Definitely not what I expected from a ""healthy"" supplement with antioxidant properties. This product feels so artificial and makes me sick.

2023-07-24,True,3,"First and foremost, I have NEVER been interested in “green juice.” It wasn’t for me. I’ve never been a fan of most vegetables and probably like most picky eaters, I refuse to eat anything green really (with a few exceptions).When I first saw Bloom on tiktok, it seemed a little too good to be true. I finally decided I’d give it a try as I’m mostly hoping it will help with any possible bloating I have on a day-to-day basis. Yes, I did buy the electrics powered mixing thing with it because I’m a sucker for marketing, however I’ve read it’s not a necessity….but it is cool to use and I’ll probably use it to mix anything and everything now!I read the instructions, decided some organic Kirkland lemonade would be my base and added the mango powder that I decided on. It wasn’t horrible, however I wanted to see if I could make it better. Tried it with water and I couldn’t even finish the whole thing without wanting to throw up. I went back to the lemonade and added a teaspoon size of raspberry syrup (the brand people use for their at home Starbucks creations) and it definitely made it better this time. I’m hoping to find a base that’s not as sugary but I feel rather limited since the taste that comes from the powder is very overwhelming.I’ll probably try the berry flavoring next if I decided to stick with it. As far as results go, I’m not 100% on if I have input or not considering I’ve only been drinking the stuff for 2 days (twice a day), however, I felt as though I wasn’t as bloated today so we’ll see. Updates to come!",3393,568,Health Supplements,4.3,,4,0.0
2023-07-31,True,3,"I got this product to add some nutrients to my day. I bought the original just because all of the flavors sounded pretty good. The price is reasonable and the packaging was good.The flavor of the original is alright. It’s light and not super grainy (I do still have powder at the bottom do my bottle if I let it sit for a few seconds). I notice a stevia taste that follows the light fruity taste at the start. The Ingredients and nutrients are refreshing to see. I’m always looking for clean, healthy items to try out. Unfortunately, the package contains stevia. Maybe I missed it, but I didn’t see stevia listed in the photo of the ingredients on Amazon. I was pretty disappointed. This green powder is supposed to help with bloating (among other things), but stevia personally makes me feel more bloated. I can’t blame the people who made the product, as a lot of companies use Stevia. Stevia can be a good alternative for sugar for people with different preferences or medical conditions. I do wish it was listed. I should have looked harder to find that information so.. the review is based on the flavor/taste and how it made my body feel.I bet this is great for a lot of people but as someone who tends to avoid sugar alternatives like stevia, I won’t be purchasing this again.",3393,568,Health Supplements,4.3,,2,0.0001

I believe that it has all of the nutrients advertised, but I personally haven’t felt any different after drinking this once a day for the past two weeks. The mango flavor does NOT taste like mango, and I didn’t realize when I purchased it, but it’s sweetened with stevia. I was under the impression it was just unsweetened when I bought it. That’s my own fault, though. I hate stevia and artificial sweeteners and should have known better than to buy without looking into that first. The stevia makes it SICKENINGLY sweet, with almost a marshmallow aftertaste (maybe from the actual marshmallow root? idk). I think I could’ve dealt if it were so friggin sweet.

2023-06-17,True,3,"Yes, you’ve seen this powder on TikTok and it’s been raved by influencers - so what is it really all about? Let’s dive in.I’m a full time working mom of three kids, as well as a fitness trainer and nutrition junkie. I love to whip up green smoothies for us on the weekends or for an evening boost. With that said, it’s not always easy to make a fresh smoothie for me for breakfast when we’re all running out the door at 6AM. Enter: Bloom.Let me just say this: if you’re going to try this greens powder, make sure you try it on a weekend when you’ll be close to a bathroom. Like, legit. After the first taste rush of visualized tropical mangoes showered in stevia, you get hit with a blast of grass. (Sometimes at the same time, depending how well you’ve mixed it.) Within 5 minutes, I was rushing to the bathroom feeling like I had to vomit. My stomach was cramping and gurgling. It wasn’t exactly how I wanted to spend a Saturday morning. But — I did notice less bloating after the 3rd day. I also weighed 5lbs less. lolAfter the 5th day, I could tell my body was getting used to it. It definitely wasn’t the same as my fresh green smoothies I make at home, or have the same effects (still waiting for that “clearer skin and more energy”), but it’s not a bad greens powder overall. There are better on the market. 3/5 stars for the favorited mango flavor with lots of stevia aftertastes, being stuck to a bathroom for almost 2 days, and for lots of maltodextrin (which has a higher glycemic index than table sugar!).",3393,568,Health Supplements,4.3,,14,0.0
2023-07-26,True,3,"I loved this product. My two main things are that this is too powdery and needs more liquid. I also think it needs more flavor like a juice to drink it with to combat some of the flavor of the green foods and also to balance the stevia to flavor ratio. Otherwise, it was great! I’ve had lots of extra energy and noticed I was feeling healthier and had less stomach pain. I have GERD and normally some of these ingredients would cause my condition to act up. After the first few days I noticed the reaction pretty much completely go away, and I just felt overall better.",3393,568,Health Supplements,4.3,,0,0.0022

In my line of work, I often skip breakfast and lunch, so having a nutritious easy to make drink is a major win.  Bloom is both good tasting and healthy.  My two complaints are: 1) if you attempt to dissolve it in water only, it does not remain blended. Within seconds you can see sediment deposit at the bottom of the glass.  Unless you chug the entire glass in one sip, then you will find yourself repeatedly blending the powder back into the water.  I have not yet tried using it in a smoothie; perhaps this works better. 2) This small jar is a bit pricey.  If I am going to have my family drink along with me, one jar will not last more than 1.5wks.  At these prices, it may be more cost effective to purchase greens and make smoothies.",3393,568,Health Supplements,4.3,,2,0.0002

If you have a sensitive stomach like I do, you might want to stay away. There is a freshness packet for humidity.. AND IT IS SMALL. it literally fits inside the scooper..

2023-07-25,True,5,"As someone who has struggled with digestive issues and bloating for quite some time, I was on the lookout for a natural and effective solution. That's when I stumbled upon the Bloom Nutrition Super Greens Powder, and let me tell you, it has been a game-changer for my gut health.First and foremost, the blend of probiotics in this powder is fantastic. Probiotics are essential for maintaining a healthy balance of gut bacteria, and I could feel the positive effects almost immediately after incorporating this product into my daily routine. My digestion became smoother, and the annoying bloating I used to experience after meals started to subside gradually.One of the key ingredients, Spirulina, is known for its rich nutrient profile and its ability to support gut health. Combined with Chlorella, another powerful superfood, the Bloom Nutrition Super Greens Powder provides a potent dose of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that have undoubtedly contributed to my overall well-being.I must mention that adding digestive enzymes to this formula is a brilliant touch. These enzymes assist in breaking down food and enhancing nutrient absorption, ensuring that your digestive system operates efficiently. Since I started using this powder, I noticed that I felt less sluggish after meals, and I no longer experienced that heavy feeling that often follows a large meal.Taste-wise, the Bloom Nutrition Super Greens Powder pleasantly surprised me. As someone who has tried several green superfood powders in the past, I was prepared for a less-than-pleasant experience. However, this product has a mild and slightly sweet taste, making it easy to mix with water or blend into my morning smoothies without overpowering the flavor.Furthermore, I appreciate that the formula is tailored specifically for women. As we have different nutritional needs, it's reassuring to know that this product is designed to support female digestive health, which sets it apart from generic greens powders on the market.Another significant advantage of this product is its convenience. The powdered form allows me to take it on the go, and I don't have to worry about swallowing large pills or capsules. The resealable packaging keeps it fresh and maintains its potency, which is essential for retaining the benefits of probiotics.In conclusion, the Bloom Nutrition Super Greens Powder has been an absolute lifesaver for my digestive health and bloating relief. The carefully chosen combination of probiotics, superfoods like Spirulina and Chlorella, and digestive enzymes makes this product a well-rounded solution for anyone seeking to improve their gut health naturally.Whether you're experiencing occasional digestive discomfort or looking to enhance your overall well-being, I highly recommend giving this product a try. It's now a staple in my daily routine, and I can confidently say that it has positively impacted my digestive health.",30116,8294,Health Supplements,4.3,,96,1.0

Bloom Greens lived up to its promise of being a digestive drink. After incorporating it into my routine, I noticed significant improvements in various aspects of my digestion.The variety of flavors they offer is a plus. Mango might not have been love at first taste, but the subsequent enjoyment made it worth the exploration. Knowing there are other flavors to try adds to the excitement.Overall, Bloom Greens has truly aided me in ways I hadn't expected.

I used to use superfood blends daily for over a year from another brand, but it was expensive and still had that ""earthy"" aftertaste. Not with Bloom though! You're still getting the same amount of nutrients from their blend and the coconut flavor means you really do only have to add water and nothing else. I enjoy adding this in to my post-workout smoothies as well and it pairs well with flavored protein power. It makes me feel great knowing I am adding such a great boost to my diet in a healthy, low-calorie, and yummy way.

I also suffer from bloating naturally. Ive been seeing this all over tiktok and thought Id give it a try and see if it helps. I like how it contains a lot of the nutrients that fruits and vegetables do and I feel like im getting all my vitamins in one go.

The texture blends smoothly with the yogurt, making it a delightful and nutritious addition to my breakfast. Not only does it enhance the flavor, but I also feel more energized and focused throughout the day.

My tummy is flatter and I’ve lost about 5lbs. It also gave my energy levels a boost. 🤩I generally mix it with cold water and use a frother to make sure it’s well blended (as directed).

I usually mix it with orange juice in the morning and the powder dissolves smoothly. I just dramatically and forcefully shake it in my lidded tumbler because I don't have a hand mixer or anything like that lol. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a quality greens and superfoods supplement. I can definitely see me buying it again after this first one is done.",30116,8294,Health Supplements,4.3,,12,0.3285
2023-07-27,True,5,"have seen bloom all over tiktok and decided to give it a try. I have tried green powder drinks in the past, but never stuck to drinking them  because I could never get past that “green juice” flavor. Bloom offers 5 flavors and I decided on the mango. I have been drinking bloom for the past week and I have to say it is way better than any green supplement I have drank in the past. I get a cup of ice with about 12 to 16 oz of water, put one scoop of bloom, mix with an electric hand mixer, and enjoy. Because of the mango flavor it had a sweetness to it that overrides the green taste. The bloom powder is suppose to boost energy, soothe bloating, balance gut health, and support immunity if taken daily and consistently. Only after a week, I  can say my bloating has decreased and feel like I have more energy after I finish a glass of it. I will definitely be repurchasing and look forward to seeing the benefits long term.",30116,8294,Health Supplements,4.3,,16,0.0002
2023-07-20,True,5,"I'm so glad I was able to try out this product.Bloom greens & superfoods is Keto, Gluten Free, Vegan and easy to use.All you do is use one scoop of powder in water or your favorite beverage. I tried it with just water which was okay. I didn't hate it but I didn't love it. So I finally tried it with different juices which was better for my liking. You can mix it with your electric mixer or you can do what I did by putting some ice, a scoop of of power and coconut water in a blender. The last step is to enjoy your drink!I really like how it boosts energy, soothes bloating, balances gut health and supports immunity. I also like that there is 30+ Nutrients in 1 Scoop.I'm glad I brought this powder with me on this 1 week stay in my mom's timeshare because eating out so much just makes me feel bloated and this definitely helps me out when I feel bloated.I'm definitely purchasing this again.",30116,8294,Health Supplements,4.3,,10,0.0039

But after taking this for 3 days every morning, the 3rd evening I felt completely terrible! I couldn't move without feeling like I was going to vomit. It was like motion sickness. I had to lay in bed. I could feel my stomach gurgling and bubbling. It causes major gas. I was burping a ton and it was like methane gas and rotten eggs. I have spent the last 3 days in the bathroom! It has completely tore my stomach up. I haven't been able to sleep because I've had to get up and go to the bathroom every 2 hours it seems.

I thought it sounded like an amazing product, and my fear of FOMO kicked in and my completely unrealistic thought process thinking that if I don’t get this in my diet immediately, I am losing out on potentially positive benefits.I saw videos of people tasting it and they all seemed to really like the taste. Naturally, I couldn’t wait to try it. And coconut flavor!? I love coconut.So I felt completely misled when I tried it. It was hardly palatable. I mean, it is not easy to get down. Coconut probably wasn’t the best choice. Best I can describe it is like drinking an incredibly awful green drink and then you panic and want to immediately get the taste out of your mouth, and you can’t find anything to wipe your tongue with because you’re driving, and all you can find is a Little Trees Coconut car freshener dangling from your rear view mirror and you decide that licking the car fresher would taste better than what you’re drinking, but the flavors mixed and everything just became worse.. And now you’re just trying to distract your mind from the bitter, earthy, artificial coconut, and strangely sweet flavor lingering in your mouth.I tried adding it to my smoothie to mask the flavor, and very unfortunately, it only masked the beautiful flavors of açaí, cocoa, strawberry and the flavor of the greens powder of course had to put on it’s sequin pants and overpower everything else.Anyway, after drinking this drink, I feel a little nauseous, a little broke and completely untrusting of anything anyone recommends on social media from this day forward.

Unfortunately within the first three days I noticed some issues. First it was my stomach hurting and feeling extra bloated. I thought maybe I needed to just get used to it and tried it a couple more days. After the first three days I noticed I started breaking out in hives ( I do suffer from chronic hives and take medicine everyday to manage this. This basically just means I’m super sensitive and get hives very easily) I realized my hives would come right after taking one serving and even my allergy medicine wouldn’t make my hives go away. I then turned to google and reviews and realized I’m not the only one experiencing these problems. I reached out on blooms IG to see if maybe they had any info or suggestions on why this is happening, if maybe I need to decrease the dose and get my body used to it or if it’s simply not meant for me. My comment got deleted TWICE. Honestly more disappointed that they REFUSE to even answer simple questions that pose health risk regarding their products. Also not addressing that some people may have sensitivity to their ingredients makes me question the production. Mari needs to do better. Like I get you are famous and it’s a big brand but come on you try to be genuine influencer and that’s why she was my favorite but sadly I realized you are just another influencer who doesn’t care about her customers just money and that’s bums me out more than being allergic to your product lol.

I mixed the second try with Crystal light and that was better but I still couldn’t see myself drinking it.

I am vegetarian around the time of taking Bloom I was meal-prepping and eating light meals. I was also juicing. Soon as I stop taking Bloom I felt better. I'm not sure why bloom made me feel more constipated and more bloated. I do not recommend taking Bloom. Buying this product made me awaken to not everything that looks healthy is good for you and just because it's trendy does not mean you should join the trendy wave.

I have been taking greens for years, and bought into the hype of these helping more with bloat. I don't recommend this product- it is so heavily flavored with Stevia it tastes terribly fake and processed. There is minimal to no stevia in all other greens I take, so this seems unnecessary. Since these were more expensive than other brands, i attempted to return (You can do this at all other retailers in store) However, Bloom has a no return policy of any kind, even a no refund. Their policies on amazon sent me around in circles trying to get assistance and I finally gave up.If you want to try these, i would suggest getting them at a retailer where bloom didn't set the return policy.

I have never liked the taste of Stevia, but nevertheless decided to continue taking the product in hopes it would help my bloating issues, and be a healthy supplement. I noticed the Stevia right away, but kept looking at the ingredients and not seeing it listed, it is hidden on a different side of the container in small text at the bottom. After a couple of weeks, I noticed that my taste buds had changed, everything tasted awful, with a similarity to the artificial taste I get from Stevia. After I stopped taking the product, a week or two later, my taste buds are much better, but still affected. I have lost the full pleasure of my beloved green tea and chocolate. I looked it up on the web, and yes I see a report that Stevia can affect your taste buds. If this is a product you can put in a smoothie, why add this artificial sweetener? Very wrong-headed.

About 5 months into taking Nervogen Pro pills, I had stopped using the topical 2-3 times a night. My leg pain was gone. Then a urinary tract infection led to sepsis.

2023-01-09,True,4,"I normally don't leave quick reviews, but thought I should this time.  I've posted my updates first, and the original review further down.UPDATE Day 3 and 4:  I backed down to (2) capsules and am tolerating them well.  I'll. hang at this dosage for a week or two to acclimate, then try doing (3) capsules again.UPDATE A COUPLE WEEKS OUT:  I have continued the 2-capsule dose each morning and and have had no further upper-GI discomfort such as I noted in the initial review.  I did order another jar of the supplement and added it to my subscriptions.  I have not tried going back to the 3-capsule recommended dose yet, but now that I've been taking it for a couple weeks or more, I feel comfortable giving the 3-capsule dose another try.  The seller offered an accommodation to me because of my experience, which I appreciated but didn't expect or require.  All our systems are different and YMMV, as they say, but I hope my posting about my experience is helpful to others.  As such, and given how well I've tolerated the 2-capsule dose, I think the bump in the road is me, not the Genius product per se.  I will post an update after trying the 3-capsule dose again.A FEW DAYS LATER:  I went back up to the 3-capsule dose and have had no upper-GI issues thus far.  I'll post again as necessary, but am baffled as to what would account for the initial experience I had unless this is simply a supplement that my particular system needed to acclimate to.  Perhaps starting with a reduced dose to assess tolerance is the gentle way to ease into this supplement?  And definitely take it with the recommended amount of water.About Six Weeks Later:I'm doing fine and dandy on this supplement at the 3-capsule dose.  Just be sure to drink the recommended amount of water when you take it.  I'm not a doctor, not making medical claims and correlation doesn't equal causation, but I will say that my thinking seems quicker and clearer these days.  I hold patents and am quite inventive, and I've been ""on fire"" lately.  I have this supplement on Subscribe & Save...and have no intention of stopping.  I'm very glad I got over the initial hurdle and stuck with it.ORIGINAL REVIEW:  The supplements arrived a couple days ago and yesterday I took (2) capsules before a meal, as the label instructs.  I didn't notice any upper GI pain.  This morning, though, I took (3) capsules and all day I've had severe GERD- or esophageal erosion-type pain that feels as if someone bored a hole through me with 3"" hole saw, all the way through to my back, accompanied by that lump-in-the-throat feeling that can accompany esophageal erosion.I did suck on some slippery elm lozenges and they seemed to help a bit, though temporarily.I'll see how I feel in the morning and will plan to take a couple days off, then give the supplement another try, but at the reduced dose.I'm wondering if anyone else who's reported upper-GI pain has stuck it out, and whether one might build up a tolerance over time.I like the packaging, the purity, the dosing and the price.  I'm just hoping I can get my system accustomed to these so I can get the full benefit from them.",4699,1050,Health Supplements,4.3,,286,0.0001

2023-07-16,True,1,"I took these capsules for just under 4 months. At first, I didn't notice side effects. During months 2-3 of taking them, my anxiety increased to where I was worrying about every little thing. I didn't put any thought into these being the culprit since I was taking them for a while. Then one day I woke up, took them with breakfast per usual and had the WORST stomach pains - I was genuinely scared cause it was so painful!! After nearly 2 hours of misery, a heating pad on my belly and ibuprofen, it subsided... but only until the next day, less than 2 hours after taking them. It happened again and again for 3 more days until I had enough of the misery and went to Urgent Care. The doctor thought maybe I had a stomach ulcer or gastritis, so he sent me home with instructions on following a certain diet and had me start taking pepcid + prilosec. I followed the diet and taking the meds to a T, eliminated coffee/acidic things etc from my diet 100%, yet the next few mornings after taking these, like clockwork I still had the worst abdominal pains.I decided to eliminate taking these morning #7 of the pain and misery.....low and behold, I didn't have stomach pain at all that day! I didn't take them for 2 more days, still had no pain. I was thinking *maybe* it's the acid reducer meds working, and not these? so I tried to take them again and THE PAIN WAS BACK. I tried this eliminate and reintroduce process one more time to be absolutely sure a couple days after that and it did still happen. I now know with 100% certainty that I don't have stomach ulcers/gastritis and it was these awful capsules the whole time. THESE ARE THE WORST!

On the label they claim to use Cordyceps Sinensis which is extremely expensive that is typically imported from far east and not grown in the USA, but they also say Cordyceps in their product is the Mycellium part of the mushroom, not the fruit of the mushroom. Mycellium is the powdery spores that grow on a substrate (the substrate for Cordyceps Sinensis is Caterpillars or other insects). This is also problematic because the majority of clinical studies done on the benefits of Cordyceps are on the fruiting bodies (the actual mushroom), not the Mycelium. Also, collecting the Mycelium and separating it from substrate (insect) is usually a contamination quality issue. When the spores are collected if even a tiny bit of bacteria with moisture is included in the mix the result can turn into a toxic poison due to mold and bacteria growth.

2023-05-06,True,1,"The company seems dodgy.  Never heard back from them when asking where they source their cordyceps. They claim to use Cordyceps Sinensis which is extremely expensive and ""is mainly found in the meadows above 3,500 metres (11,500 ft) on the Tibetan Plateau in Tibet and the Himalayan regions of Bhutan and Nepal"" (WIkipedia), yet they say the mushroom are grown in the USA. Not sure how this is possible which is why I wanted clarification, but never heard back from them. They also say that the cordyceps in their product is the Mycellium which is also problematic because the majority of clinical studies done on the benefits of cordyceps mushrooms (and all mushrooms for that matter) are on the fruiting bodies (the actual mushroom), not the mycelium.Tried these supplements for a full month.

2023-02-04,True,2,"Truth be told, many medicinal mushroom products are actually not made from mushrooms.What they are made from is the mushroom's root system, called mycelium, which is grown on grain and this grain cannot be separated from the mycelium so it ends up being a significant ingredient in the final product.This grain contributes a high amount of starch to the final product leaving you with little to no beta glucans (the medicinal compounds that you want).Iodine can be used to test for the presence of starch. By doing an iodine starch test, you can see if your mushroom product contains grains or other fillers like dextrose or maltodextrin. mushroom starch testInstructions: Get a mushroom product to testAdd one gram of mushroom powder to 3 tablespoons of warm water.Stir the mushroom powder into the warm water to dissolve it as much as possible.Add 10 drops of iodine to the water mixture and then stir it in.If the mixture turns black, this confirms that a large portion of the product is starch and not what you've paid for.",1012,196,Health Supplements,4.3,,13,0.1849

However, I started getting sick after the 3rd week. I would break the capsules open, following the recommended dosage, and mix them with my morning coffee. During the 3rd or 4th week, I noticed something change. While drinking my coffee with the mushrooms in it, I would get this sudden wave of nausea come over me, like a hot flash.  A couple of time I thought I was going to puke. So I decided to take a break from the shrooms. I took an entire week off and had no experiences with nausea. So, after 7 days, I decided to try them again. Nope. As I am writing this, I mixed them with my coffee this morning and once again had that feeling of nausea come over me.

It wasn't like me. I'm a massive nerd.Anyway, these symptoms lingered and it was incredibly frustrating. Then, I decided to try mushrooms. It was on a whim because I'd heard there could be some efficacy for concentration and I could barely hold a thought. I specifically looked up one that helped memory but I won't lie - because of my difficulty holding a thought, I just said ""f it"" and got the first one with the names of the mushrooms I'd read. Didn't even check if it was the ""right"" kind of cordyceps.The first time I tried them - nothing. I didn't get it. After about a week, I suddenly felt something after taking them again.It felt like my brain reconnected. No joke, but it felt like - all of a sudden - I physically felt an electric zap like something reconnected in my brain.The fog cleared and my brain ""fixed"". I physically felt it. And no, it was not concussion symptoms receding as it was over 3 months ago by that point and I had already been struggling with memory even BEFORE that concussion that made it worse and caused a daze. I have never before felt such a thing in my life.I am firmly of the belief that, somehow, this coaxed my brain into healing. I do not understand it but I can recall words again. I don't have quite the same personality anymore but that's probably from hitting my head so many times. Kids, don't do that. Wear a helmet.In any case, this would barely be legible if I was still typing how I typed before. These mushrooms were a lifesaver for me and somehow exactly what my brain needed.

2018-07-16,True,5,"This supplement is pretty awesome and so far, I'm a fan of The Genius Brand. Besides this product, I also recently tried Genius Sleep Aid and would give that one 4/5 stars. This supplement contains 3 of some of the most known medicinal mushrooms that are out there: Lion's Mane, Cordyceps and Reishi. For me personally, I feel like the supplement has helped me adapt to stress (like how an adaptogen feels), gives me more energy (but not like in a stimulant like way, like caffeine), and has also helped me cognition and focus, especially when it comes to things like college work. I also have anxiety disorders - primarily social anxiety and OCD and I feel like the supplement has definitely calmed these issues down and helped me work through them lately for sure.Here's some medicinal qualities of the 3 mushrooms, based of what studies have shown:Lion's Mane - May help alleviate mild symptoms of depression and anxiety, could protect against dementia, reduces heart disease risk, may help fight Cancer, reduces inflammation and can boost the immune system.Cordyceps - May boost exercise performance (mostly through increasing oxygen utilization), increases the body's production of ATP (the main source of energy in every human's body), has potential anti-tumor effects, decreases ""bad"" cholesterol (LDL cholesterol), may also help fight inflammation.Reishi - Acts an an antioxidant and also helps with inflammation, reduces anxiety and depression, helps prevent Cancer, can be helpful for people with sleeping problems, aids gut health, helpful in relieving symptoms due to allergies.I hope this helps anyone interested in this supplement or looking to try mushrooms as medicine. I've been taking supplements for a little over a decade now of various types and I only recently became interested in trying and researching medicinal types of mushrooms and it's safe to say, I will keep continuing to try these types of natural medicines and research more of them.

After about 2/3 days I noticed the clarity and I was sharper when coming to remembering stuff. I also take TRT and work out 3/5 days a week. I have been working at a lot more since taking these. I’m not sure if they are the Motivating fact but not sure what else it could be. Now my recovery has been great I haven’t been sore the next day even after a hard workout. I just ran out about 3 days ago and forgot to re-order. The second day after not taking any I was abnormally sore the next day. After the fourth day not having any I feel like I got hit by a truck after working out the following morning. I am almost 90% sure it is the cause not having any in my system. It’s too much of a coincidence. I just ordered these with same day delivery. If it doesn’t work I will update post.

2022-08-26,False,3,"I admit that my primary reason for loving these gummies are they come in little tiny bear shapes and are so cute!  But, taking that into account, these gummies also do the job by providing your daily amount of Iron (very important to us pre-menopausal women) depending on how many you consume and what you have eaten throughout the day.  Taking 2 gummies only gives you 56% of the daily amount needed but that should be enough depending on what you eat throughout the day.  Of course, your habits may differ and you will want to read up on exactly what you need.Not only were the gummies in a cute shape but they have a pleasant taste and smell.  They were easy to chew, had no after effects and did not cause constipation (as some iron supplements can do).  You also get the added benefit of other Vitamins in the gummie, such as Vitamin A, C, B6 and B12.  It is also vegan, non-GMO, no Gluten and has 90 gummies per bottle (that should last 45 days if you take 2 per day).The cost is a bit higher than compared to other iron supplements in pill form and some other gummies.  At the cost of $18.99, you will be able to find other more reasonably priced gummies on the market.  As such, I can't give it the full 5 stars.This gummie might be exactly what you need if you are anemic (as the added Vitamins will help with absorption) but once your iron is regulated, finding other iron products that are cheaper would be the way to go.

2022-09-05,True,2,"Not a huge fan. Gummy iron is hard to come by and I've tried all sorts of iron pills and they all make my GI system super irritated, so when I saw this, I thought, oh, it's only 10mg, but I guess it has less other vitamins, so I'll add it to my multi pill so I'm not just getting the dismal 18mg from a multi pill, but also not overdosing on the other vitamins if I just double the pill. The taste is fine to me, not too much of an aftertaste, but rather than gummy, it's more like a soft fruit puree bar texture. The price is what gets me. My 1yrs worth of multi vitamins with 18mg of iron is $10, when I first bought these it was a discounted $13, and it just seems to climb and climb. As of today it's over $18 apparently for a month and a half. For a minuscule 10mg of iron, unless you're absolutely desperate to have a low iron gummy supplement, don't bother.",15,7,Health Supplements,4.4,,1,0.0007
2022-08-30,False,4,"I'm a total sucker for anything peach flavored, and supplemental iron is a need in my world.  A peach flavored iron gummi?  Yes, please.Let's start with the label.  Vegan.  Made in the USA.  Free from allergens.  Halal.  The nutrition panel shows facts for both one and two gummis, with an age range for each - nice touch.  As I'm on the upper end of the spectrum, I'll be referring to that.As well as Iron, they contain Vitamin A, C, B6, Niacin, Folate, D-Biotin, Pantothenic Acid, and Zinc.  The amounts range from 3% to 94% - as I'd be using this primarily as an iron supplement, I'd consider the rest to be a bonus.The flavor is key, though, as wanting to take them is the most important part.  The bears are small, matte and opaque maroon.  The texture is more fruit chew than gummi, with a definite peach - and iron supplement, which is tough to cover - flavor.  A stronger peach would hide it better.I'll definitely use these, but would probably not reorder as the iron flavor is more than the peach flavor.",78,20,Health Supplements,4.4,,3,0.0002

I also take them (I had a lower Red BC count and was a point or two away from anemic so I’ve been taking two a day for a while now. Will continue to do so - I’m sure I’ll have more blood work done in the future and will come back to edit this review and note if things have improved. Which hopefully the have!

I don't know how to describe it exactly, it's like metallic but spoiled somehow?When you first chew it just tastes like a peach gummy, but the more you chew, you get this really awful flavor that stays in your mouth afterward. I almost wondered if I just had a bad batch because a lot of the reviews are very positive but some of them also mention this taste. If you chew them quickly it's not so bad.

2022-08-01,False,5,"This enzyme formula is kind of modeled after the classic Wobenzym formula, which has been clinically proven to help with inflammation. This formula contains many enzymes that I already take regularly, and I do believe that they have an anti-aging and anti-inflammatory effect. I take them before my workout.This formula contains some important proteolytic enzymes, which when taken on an empty stomach get absorbed into the bloodstream and work their magic. Bromelain is particularly powerful, and has been shown to help prevent sports injuries. Papain works in a similar way. Serrapeptase and nattokinase seem to help break up fibrin in the blood, and thus may have a role in breaking up clots.Rutin is not an enzyme, but may help provide other benefits. When broken down, Rutin splits into quercetin and another bioflavonoid, so it possibly provides the same benefits as quercetin.This is a good formula from a trusted brand. I recommend it.

I did end up getting a headache later in the evening but idk if that’s related because I always get headaches & if it is, it’s probably because I didn’t eat when I took them which also caused a little nausea so I had a smoothie & it helped.

Most of them were too much money and didn't offer a variety blend.Then, I stumbled upon this gem. I take two capsules every morning with breakfast to help with my cognition, immune system, ADHD, CPTSD, and depression. Within a week I noticed I was concentrating better, had less anxiety, more motivation, and even my allergies were not as bad. It took me about four weeks to experience the full benefits. I'm enjoying life more without my symptoms getting in the way.If you're looking for a reasonably-priced mushroom blend supplement to add to your health regimen, I highly recommend this product.

2023-01-13,False,4,"I really love these mushroom supplements. I had heard about the health benefits of incorporating more mushrooms in my diet from various health & wellness blogs & podcasts. I know right, don't believe everything you see on the internet, smh. Still, I was skeptical at how worthwhile these powder supplement capsules would actually be. Would I even feel any real effects from them, or do health-conscious individuals just take these everyday believing in their efficacy whole-heartedly? The supplement industry, sadly, is well-known for slapping labels on anything that sounds trendy, has influencers hawking their nutritional value, or telling people exactly what they want to hear.These Clean Nutraceutical (CN) mushroom supplements are actually really good, quality products. I can genuinely say that I feel like CN does a great job vetting their products & ensuring their quality. I'm sure even CN isn't above pushing out certain trendy supplements that sell based solely on influencer nonsense, but that's a discussion for another day.These mushroom 'blend' supplements are surprisingly effective. I actually feel a genuine sense of relaxation, calmness & overall well-being that's noticeable about 10-15min after consuming. Their claims of being used for focus, energy & enhanced cognition are legitimate. I think its pretty well-established what the various health benefits of mushrooms are, but I would personally never purchase all these different types of mushrooms, and eat them with my meals. The convenience of having this complex, blended in an easy-to-use pill capsule definitely sounded like something I could do. I usually take them in the morning, and times when I would usually be stressed out, or having anxiety before work, I feel an overwhelming sense of calmness when I start my day. It's actually extremely effective in helping me focus on my work, and everyday tasks. I'm definitely not a mushroom expert by any means, but I have heard of some these specific mushroom types, like cordyceps, lions mane, shiitake. But I can vouch for how they make me feel, and for the cost, I think these CN supplements are well worth the money. I've compared them to some of the other brands I've seen on Amazon, and I've even tried a different brand after I used up my bottle of Clean Nutraceuticals, and tbh I can't tell a huge difference between the more expensive brand offerings. Seems like they're all using similar blends of popular mushroom species, so I don't know if there's a big difference between them. The pills themselves are in standard capsules, easy for me to swallow, but if you don't like taking pills, you could easily open these up & mix them in some water or tea.If you're looking for a natural, non habit-forming way to lower your stress levels or anxiety, I would highly recommend you try these mushroom supplements. I'm extremely happy with my purchase, and I would definitely re-order from Clean Nutraceuticals again. If you're wondering how useful they are, I never really ate mushrooms much before, or thought of taking a mushroom supplement, but these are now something I consume on a daily basis with my multivitamins & other various supplements, so yeah. These were definitely a good value compared to other brands, I would just say try them yourself, and you'll see exactly what I'm talking about.",231,20,Health Supplements,4.4,,24,0.0
2022-11-01,False,4,"I’m an advocate of consuming mushrooms, as a food and supplement, for the potential healthful benefits.

Note that these five mushrooms are in 10:1 extract form, which indicates considerable concentration of these mushrooms.The sixth component of this mushroom supplement, 180mg per capsule, is called ShroomZoom Blend.

The product label displays only Made In USA, there is no mention on the label regarding 3rd Party Lab Tested for Potency & Purity. This absence dings the rating, calling into question quality control (especially with no certification for being a GMP or FDA registered facility).I think that is’ an impressive feat to include 20 mushrooms in one supplement.

I can't speak for the swallowing of these capsules as I have a feeding tube and as I do with all my medication I mixed it with warm water and poured it in.  No adverse effects to my stomach!  However, on the 4th day after taking these I developed a headache, well there were several viruses going around and I assumed I must be headed for that joy ride.  Well, the next day it was a lot worse with no other symptoms ( but Covid tested to be safe as I couldn't sleep due to the headache- Negative test).  The third day with the headache it was just like a full blown migraine and I've not had one of those in over 12 years.  So I thought the only thing I had changed was taking the supplement.  The next day I did not take them with no change to the headache.  The following day it was no longer on the migraine level and the third day of not taking them I was at a tolerable headache without feeling like I needed to take ibuprofen as soon as I opened my eyes.  So it resolved after stopping the supplements.  I did my research before taking the supplements with my other medications and found no ""red flags"".

As of today, I will stop the Fruit part of it and see if I feel better.  I think I am going to continue with the veggie part for now.

I had such a terrible reaction and I was considering going to the hospital.  My wife brought up the issue of Grapefruit and Blood Pressure, and there it was.

After not having any extra energy after 2 months of this stuff i stopped taking it . Within 1-2 days i noticed i was only getting up to go pee once or none at all so i cancelled the urologist appt .

I took them apart and there was definitely some kind of mold on them. I quit taking them that day. I’m going to a different brand that is FDA approved and the price is so good that both my husband and I can take them. I looked at other reviews not on Amazon and they have MANY complaints to the BBB. Just do your homework before you buy this product. Their advertising is just a lot of hype. Their customer service is located in Africa, India, and another Country I couldn’t even understand the lady when she told me. You can’t reach anyone in the United States anymore. When you get someone they have no clue as to what you’re asking them. Forget about getting help also they keep giving you different numbers to call.

2022-02-10,True,1,"I took this as directed every day for over three years.  I took it because my mother thought it might help my chronic migraines.  I never noticed anything good or bad about taking it.  It seemed to make little difference on my migraines or my general health, but my mother asked me to continue, so I did.In early December I did a review of all my supplements to see if any should be changed or dropped or if I should continue taking them.  I went through dozens of reviews for each supplement on multiple websites.  I happened across one review for the Balance of Nature saying it caused them massive heart burn.  One thing that has bothered me in the last few years was a serious increase in heart burn, acid reflux.  It was taking a toll on my quality of life and required a huge change in diet, which had almost zero effect on the heart burn.  After reading the review where the person mentioned their own heart burn, I decided to take a month off of the BN.  Within a few days my life was already better.  I've been off BN for exactly three months and I don't even think about heart burn.  I eat what makes me happy again.  My improved digestion and quality of life are the only differences I've noticed since abandoning BN; there's been no difference in my migraines, nor my energy levels.If this works for you, then bless you, but if you've noticed an increase of digestive issues, please consider taking a break from this extraordinarily expensive supplement.",1318,651,Health Supplements,4.1,,162,0.0001

If they just LEFT it at that, I would respect them much more. But no, they have to put on stupid testimonials from paid actors or people reacting to the placebo effect, because testimonials help sell products (that's just a simple fact). anyway, having said all of this, I use the product.

Well this is only initial review and first impressions while the final verdict is still out.  Opened  the capsules into V8 juice and carrot juice in a shaker and it was palatable enough.  Smells fresh of whole food.  Anyway, was feeling rather lethargic at the time taking them due to the absence of morning caffeine.

On several instances, when brought to their attention, they provided a discount on future purchases, no big deal, given the cost of goods, I would expect the quality to be on par with the product. I was not seeking a discount or free product but merely to receive what I was paying for.  Perhaps if so much was not being spent on advertisement as opposed to Quality Assurance/Quality Control, this review would not be necessary.  So after my many years of customer loyalty, it's time to jump ship; I've now switched to Simply Nature's competing product, another American-made product, which is delivered without crushed or empty capsules thus far, at a lesser price.

I would pay extra for that.Of the 20 cal for 2 gummies, about 12 calories are from sugar (3grams).  The first two ingredients are glucose syrup and sugar.  It's a little sweet and hard to tell if the little pick me up this afternoon was from the Ginseng or the sugar (not a big sugar consumer).On the other hand, it is Kosher and Halal and the seller states it is manufactured in a certified good manufacturing practice facility.  The ingredients are really simple and there is no added chemical colors listed.I had to look up what 6:1 Panax Ginseng extract means.  For one, Panax Ginseng is considered the best quality ginseng.  The ratio listed means there is a soft extraction process with the herb and a product, such as methanol (40%) V/V, to get the 6:1 ratio of ginseng into this product.  A lot of products have to use an extraction method to extract the digestible panax ginseng from the root and in this case the extraction gives 2 dummies the equivalent of 96 mg whole herb.This is a product of Israel and packaged in the USA. Nothing in the product states it is organic.

This ""made in Israel"" ginseng product is very interesting, since most of the ginseng products are either from Korea or Wisconsin. Anyway here is what I thinkIngredients:It's practically the mixture of sugar, wax and ginseng extract. I really don't like the concept of reverse dilution (6:1 extract) because I don't think it's really accurate and somewhat misleading. How do you concentrate mass into higher mass? Generally, liquid extract should be marked as percentage or volume in my opinion. Anyhow, they said it's 96mg equivalent of ginseng extract. Since it doesn't have suggested daily intake, so I have no idea whether it's a lot or not. In my opinion, 3g of sugar per serving is excessive for a health supplement, so be aware of it. It doesn't have any food coloring nor fructose corn syrup so nothing funky is in the product at least.Taste & Effectiveness:It's really tasty, it has very fresh peach scent but it is also very sweet, so I deduced one star. If you like sweet stuffs, you will like it. At least it's not super bitter like Jungkwanjang ginseng extract (which I don't hate. It's weirdly tasty.) Well, I am taking so many gummies and supplements so I cannot say much but I feel slightly less tired after taking this product for 3 days. I think how effective is this product is totally depend on who is taking.

I even want to use the red light on my tummy after I give birth to see if it helps!",144,40,Beauty,3.9,,20,0.0066
2022-12-06,True,5,"I use the blue light and ""nourishing mode"" in the morning to spot treat breakouts.  It works well after serum and combined with salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide.  I am way less stressed about breaking out because this actually does help it go away faster -- they dramatically smaller than they would be without it after one use.The warming mode feels really nice, and after a stressful day it really does help me relax the tension in my face. I use it with the red light and I think I do see a subtle difference in my skin overall, though I'm less consistent with it.  I use blue and red on dark spots over vitamin C serum or azelaic acid, and I do think it's helping.It's very lightweight, which is great.  I've had it for a few months now and haven't had to charge it.  This is replacing a bulky high frequency wand which worked for breakouts, but I think the results of this are actually better and it's way more travel friendly and easier to use since it doesn't need to be plugged in.The eye mask they provide doesn't block the strong light enough, so I recommend getting a pair of LED goggles to protect your eyes.  And lock your bathroom door because this device + goggles + headband + headphones if you are like me looks a bit mad scientisty.My only recommendation to the manufacturers is that the instructions could be clearer.  There is some contradictory info about red/blue light on this page, so I looked to online dermatology info for clarification.Still experimenting to figure out how spot treatment works best--whether it's better to just put the LED light that's on the side of the device over the area, since the middle of the device is just the current with no light, or whether it's better to move the device around and do both.Overall, I definitely think this is an impactful skincare investment, and definitely for the price.",671,273,Beauty,3.9,,34,0.0001
2023-04-17,True,5,"I was skeptical about the results I would get from this device but wanted to try out the product because massaging the face is not my favorite task and also with my age to be over 50 years old.The results are seen the very next day.  I noticed that the skin breakout and redness diminish in the morning if used the night before.  The skin stays smooth if used in the morning.  The lotion is absorbed much faster.  I use the warm setting most of the time; I think the blood flow is promoted that way.  I used the cool setting after the lotion and cream if I felt like it.I cannot tell the visible effect on the tightness of the skin by the way I am using it.This is a time saver - no massage cream is needed, which means no mess to clean up.  Only a 30 seconds to 1 minute application provides results mentioned above.I got one for my nephew who has teenage skin problems because I liked it so much.  I recommended to my family and friends to the extent that they thought I was a distributor of the device.  I am considering getting this for a Christmas gift this year.",671,273,Beauty,3.9,,12,0.0032

It’s so comforting and the warming option is my absolute favorite!I’m 32 and am dealing with skin that’s beginning to change.. which has caused me to take better care of it 🤦🏼‍♀️This device is absolutely wonderful!!! I haven’t seen drastic changes, but the relaxing effects of the warming setting alone are worth it!! I use a Vitamin C serum with it to help it glide on my skin easier.For the price, it’s a great option!!PROS:  -Incredibly affordable option  -Different settings are great for different skin issues  -Warming setting is relaxing and soothing  -Chargeable.. so you don’t have to worry about a cordCONS:  -No noticeable changes in skin  -Can’t really tell if it’s working or not, but it is soothingOverall I’d say it’s a great purchase and am very happy I have it!!!",671,273,Beauty,3.9,,8,0.1679
2023-04-29,True,5,"I think this device works really well. However, about four months in,the vibration feature just stopped working. I just ordered another one. I hope it will last longer since I do like the effect. I would give it a five star for the effect, but lowering to 4 star because it broke. If the next one breaks too, I will give it a two star.Update: I charged the unit (despite that it has not yet lost all of its charge) and the vibration feature came back! So I guess it just needs to be fully charged to be able to run all features simultaneously!  Changed my review to 5 stars because I do think it’s effective",671,273,Beauty,3.9,,7,0.0063

I absolutely LOVE the different options for usage but my favorite thing is the warming function. After I take off my make up at night, I go through the different serums and lotions I have and spend time using the nourishing function to get it all soaked into my face, then I spend the most time with the warming function. It feels so soothing running across my face and chest. The bonus is the red and blue light functions you can use as well. I feel this thing keeps its charge for a long time so I can just keep it on my night table and pick it up to use while laying in bed watching tv. It’s the little extra things we do for our skin that help to keep it looking healthy and tight. Would highly recommend this tool.",671,273,Beauty,3.9,,18,0.0001

From what I can tell the light therapy, both red and blue, is very effective and I've noticed an improvement. However, I only use it once a week compared to every day since it seemed my skin became more sensitive. My daughter uses the microcurrent mode to help develop a more balanced face. Overall, we are pleased with the results. Even though it's very easy to use, I wish there were more instructions for each feature.

2022-11-07,True,2,"This facial massager is very easy to hold and I like the circut design so that it runs only when your hands and face connect or touch. I've tried to use this device for the past few weeks despite it having little felt vibrations. I wanted to assume the subtlety of it was because it was high frequency. My hand vibrates more than my face though. When I'm done, I can feel my hand tingling. It seems that something is off or turned backward. The sound it gives off would make you think that a good sensation would be given. Because of this, it does not provide any cleansing power. I tried using the lights and have not noticed any skin changes (good or bad) so at least it's not making anything worse. It is definitely not worth $40 in my opinion. I could have purchased a stronger massager for just a bit more money. Yes, it would not have had the light therapy but at least the vibrations would have been relieving. I purchased this item to help relax the muscles in my face when they are tight and painful. I wanted something small that would fit in my purse and it does meet that requirement. Needless to say though, this does not work for relieving facial tension. The only feature I do like is the heating element. That works well. It is possible that my device is defective but I wouldn't chance purchasing another one or recommending it to a friend.",60,18,Beauty,3.9,,19,0.0014

I'm so glad I did not spend 109.00 on this, and I am mad I spent $40.  I was excited to get it because I really wanted to use the LED red light  1.  There are no real instruction on how to use, other than putting a cotton pad on it when cleansing.  The cotton pad BTW blocks the LED light and left white fuzz all over my face.  2.  7 in 1, there are 7 settings that all do the same thing, vibrate. You can vibrate with no LED, with the red LED or the blue LED. There is not difference between the cleansing or nourish. 3. after a week of using, the cover on buttons came off.  4. After using for about 2 weeks I could not tell if the vibrating did any good.  Plus it is such a hassle to use, so I stopped.  Save your money, do not buy this.",60,18,Beauty,3.9,,3,0.0003

The fabric is soft, and the cut is roomy.But, seriously. The pockets on the pants are sewn in backward! Can I still use them? Sure. Do I chuckle every time I try? Absolutely. There is also a seam that doesn’t quite match up on the neck of the top, but I don’t notice it when it’s on.If you want something that says “I’m cute and cozy without trying” in a public setting, don’t buy this.

2021-03-17,True,3,"So I'm honestly  quiet a bit disappointed  with this. I wanted to love it more than I do. The top is boxy and not long like the pictures  suggest it would be. I hate that 99.9% of these Asian cloth manufacturers  make the products  look so much softer and nicer in the pictures  than they really are. Its not fair, false advertising,  just show us what it really is or make better products.  As far as the fabric  goes it is at least thicker than some, but it is still the standard  made in Asia fabric that all these sort of things are nowadays. I would not spend $35 on this again.  It's more of a $18-20 set in my opinion.  I ordered  a large because I have do do blood thinner injections  in my belly twice a day for rest of my life, and need things bigger and soft  because  of the bruises. The top is much shorter than pictures I had hoped it would cover my but like in the picture but it does not.  The sleeves would have been too short in a medium and I'm not tall I'm average  5' 6"" and 150 I fit into a medium  but buy larger due to the above stated reasons.",385,66,Womenwear,4.2,,27,0.0001

I found the top to be cut rather short, super boxy & wide open around the neckline... not very flattering. Plus the sleeves are really long, I have to fold the cuffs up or it's all the way over my hands. The pants fit much better. Good length for someone my height. I tend to be smaller in the waist & a little hippy, but this waist band is borderline tight. Fits well, but a little tighter than I like for lounging. If you carry weight in the middle or want a loose comfy pant,  these might not be the loungers for you. The tie string is also really long & totally unnecessary, I just pulled it out.

It will be perfect!The garment did have a mildly chemical smell coming out of the bag, so I washed it prior to wearing.  I used cold water and a short cycle, and turned the pants and top inside out.  I hung them to dry, and they came out beautifully- almost free of any wrinkles at all.The color showed no fade or color bleed after this initial wash.I usually wear a size 10, tending to be on the fuller side of 10 if I gain a couple pounds (holiday weight gain anyone?).  I wanted a somewhat slouchy fit, like in the model, so I opted for the size Large.  I am very happy with the size.  Not too large.  Not too fitted.  Very comfy.As for the fabric, it is lighter weight, rather than sweatshirt weight.  It’s not tissue or see through.  I would compare the fabric to a moderate weight soft tee shirt with a nice drape.

I just ordered a size M as well to compare. Also these pants are actually long enough - which if you’re tall, you know that’s hard to find!The only downside was it did have a chemical fabric smell for sure, straight out of the bag.

2022-05-28,True,5,"I absolutely love this product & all the products made by Advanced Trichology! My hair before menopause & a couple of major surgeries started to cause severe hair loss & damage. I started to research products that stated they stand behind their promise of the products. I looked at several products & also did medical research about hair loss. I compared it to the products with Advanced Trichology reviews. They gave me encouragement & I thought what do I have to lose besides more hair which was making me very self-conscious. The first order I place was for the DHT blocker and I had only taking it for a couple of weeks and went to see my best friend which is also my stylist and she had been trying to help me with my hair loss issues. She started to cut my hair and she was like oh my you have a ton of new hair growth and she showed it to me and also told me that the back of my head should be itching really bad because the back side of my head was full of new hair growth and she said when your hair grows like that and that quickly you would probably get some itching as a result and that was. So she trim my hair and I went back in a month's time and by then I had already added Folligrowth and NutraM to my daily regiment. She was just as excited as I was about my hair growth filling back in bald patches that looks so horrible that I would wear a ball cap everywhere I went because I was ashamed of how my hair looked and how thin it was. She was so excited about it she wanted to actually add these products to her stock in her salon. I told her I purchased these products on Amazon but maybe she could contact the company direct and see if she could actually sell these products from her salon. As she was finishing my cut for that day another client came in and she actually had pictures from where my hair was so thin you could see my scalp and several places to what it looks now and was telling this client about these products. This client also purchased a regiment kit from advance trichology and my stylist is keeping me updated on this other ladies hair growth. I am so glad I was able to share with that other woman that day because she had been feeling the same way that I had for years with low self-esteem, being very self-conscious and just plain and simple embarrassed about how I looked. I am actually placing my order for my next bottle of DHT blocker I still have some Folligrowth and the NutriM and I am now adding the EFA Complete to my daily styling and being healthy habits. I am very excited about what new results I will be seeing and I am so thankful and grateful for Advanced Trichology being true about their products and to their customers by standing behind the products that if you're not satisfied you get your money back but also they are so confident in their product did they give away free bottles of whichever you would like to try that's how much they guarantee and know that this product really works and I can't say thank you enough for helping me get my self-confidence back and especially my hair. I am Native American and I have always been really protective over my hair. In our culture your strength comes from your hair and also your beauty. Do yourself a favor and try these products. I do not think you will be dissatisfied. I know I love these and will continue to be a lifetime customer of Advanced Trichology!! By the way I am honestly an actual customer and this was not a paid for review it was paid for from my heart being thankful for honest people and a great company! Thanks for reading😁UPDATE: Everywhere I Go and everybody that I know cannot believe how great that my hair looks and how much thicker that it's grown back because it fell out to literally you can see my scalp and I was so embarrassed about it but it was from health issues and menopause and I added the EFA complete and oh my goodness my hair my stylist could not believe how long and more volume that my hair has. I'm going to start keeping pictures so I can show the difference from month to month on here believe me if you want something that will help you and that really works this is definitely the product and it is definitely the company anything I've used on them and I've used several of their products the serum that EFA the DHT blocker and Foligrowth and when I style my own hair I am amazed at the difference these products is made so I will keep this updated do yourself a favor try all of this products good luck and God bless!",9447,4806,Health Supplements,4.3,,310,0.00015000000000000001
2023-07-13,True,5,"I’ve been taking this product for about 2 months now. I don’t take it as directed since three heavy dose vitamins in one day seems like a lot. I take this once a day. In addition, I use hair strengthening masks twice a week and biotin serums after daily wash. I also use apple cider vinegar shampoo mixed with rosemary and mint. After I shower, I always apply Garnier 10 in 1 (highly recommend) and hair thickening serums (Paul Mitchell or Cibu brands for me). I’ve suffered from damaged hair and fining of the hair due to high heat styling. I had curly thick hair up until about 18 years of age. I ironed my hair every day basically until now at 27 years of age. It caused my hair to become fried, fine, and quite frizzy. I also have naturally oily hair so it’s almost a must for me to wash daily. I’ve decided to make a change while I’m still ahead since noticing I’ve had hair loss or just hair thinning to do the heat. I try to only heat style maybe once to twice a week now. If I do, I apply heat protectant beforehand then after it’s styled and dry, I apply Moroccan oil or Coconut oil spritz from mid hair to ends to keep my hair healthy after. This keeps it from becoming dry and splitting. The main thing I have noticed is to keep your scalp healthy and your ends silky and smooth. I know some of us are embarrassed by our natural hair (myself included big time), but it’s best to embrace it. All we really want is healthy hair. Since starting this routine, I’ve noticed new hair growth and my natural waves returning. I also lose less hair in the shower, which to me signifies hair strengthening. My hair is less frizzy so I feel more comfortable wearing it natural.

Its also impressive that this is the first and only brand accepted by the American Hair Loss association. Im excited to continue using FoliGROWth and hope the results continue.

For 2 years Ive been taking another hair, skin, and nail supplement that I kept buying from a large bulk-purchase warehouse type store, but it cost the same money as FoliGROWTH, and it had half the ingredients. I felt like it helped my skin more than my hair. I especially wanted to start taking saw palmetto, and all of the other amazing ingredients in FoliGROWTH cant be beat for the price. I've looked into one of FoliGROWTH's biggest competitors, and I dont believe that their one-pill solution for double the price is worth the money. Im usually really sensitive to supplements, and after taking FoliGROWTH Im not having any issues whatsoever, so Im thrilled. I feel like my hair is improving after a short period of time, and I cant wait to see the longer-term results of taking FoliGROWTH. Im also going to order the Advanced Trichology DHT Blocker pill and see how that works for me. If the Foligrowth plus DHT Blocker pills work well and dont cause any bad side-effects for me, then Im certain that its money well-spent.

I took this for several weeks and not only did my hair seem to grow faster, but the shedding dramatically reduced. I've not tried the DHT. I'm in my 50's so I felt I was probably deficient in something and while expensive, it worked. I'm definitely not going to stop. The one time I did [didn't take it on a cruise this summer] I came back and my hair was shedding like crazy. Restarted the pills and a few weeks later the shedding reduced again so I'm definitely deficient in something that these pills fix. If you shed a lot, it's worth trying it to see if it helps.

I’ve been struggling with my hair for years and now I think of found the right way to take care of it. I also pair these supplements with other hair care routines and includes an oil mask every Sunday. The oil mask consists of at least 6 different oils I combine in a mason jar. All in all this is an amazing product and I definitely recommend giving this a try!",9447,4806,Health Supplements,4.3,,1,0.1564
2023-05-12,True,5,"I started noticing my hair thinning a bit as I got into my early 40s and it seemed like it would reach a certain length and just absolutely not grow any further. A couple timesmy hairdresser chopped my hair, and it would take literally years to grow back out. I also wear my hair in a ponytail every day at the gym and use heat styling tools. All those contribute to thinning hair and breakage, combine that with age, and it found me looking for hair supplements. I tried Nutrafol but after the first month I had terrible stomach pain and cramps (landing me in the ER!). I had to stop taking it, eventually was able to return to taking it, but only 1 tablet a day (instead of the prescribed 4). Obviously at that reduced point, it just didn’t work well enough and it wasn’t worth the price point. So I did a little bit of unscientific Internet research, which led me to FoliGrowth. I hesitated to take the full serving size of 3 tablets because of my experience with Nutrafol, so most days I take either one or two tablets. I’m almost through my first bottle and even taking a reduced amount I see an encouraging difference! I finally see some length to my hair (which let’s be honest, might be attributable to just time and normal growth and all the collagen I also take), but I also have very minimal shedding since starting FoliGrowth and I’m seeing a few baby hairs around my hair line. It’s a positive enough experience to order more and keep going. The pills are not difficult for me to swallow, but my advice is to drink lots of water with these because I think they are a little bit constipating.",9447,4806,Health Supplements,4.3,,15,0.0
2023-06-15,True,5,"Ok so I thought I would wait 2-3 months before I actually wrote a review especially because I’m the type that wants to see results the next day. So with that being my toxic trait I didn’t think anything was working the first month of taking this. So I bought a 2nd bottle to keep going and that’s when I started seeing results. I slowly stated noticing my hair wasn’t falling as much, now I will say that I understand that it’s normal for hair to fall when you wash it especially if you don’t wash it everyday but I have lost so much hair and I literally felt like I barely had anything left. Using this has definitely reduced that AND I have noticed my hair has grown dramatically. Like I literally saw it get longer 1 month to another. I also started noticing more baby hairs 🥹. I’ll be on my 3rd bottle soon and I only recently started pairing it with the DHT blocker so I can’t really tell if that’s helping yet. But it does work! I wanted to put an honest, long review for those who are like me and lack consistency but consistency is key with this! You definitely need to take it with food or else it will make you nauseous.

2023-06-02,True,3,"I really wanted this to work, and different things work differently on each individual, but on about the 3rd or 4th day that I took it, my stomach was not acting as it should, and I had to return it.  I can't say it is a bad product or a good one.  It just affected me personally in a negative way, and I did not want to take a chance of whatever that was to get worse.  But as you will see from the reviews, many other people said they had no effects, and their hair grew.  Another person said it caused them to vomit, so it just all depends on your system I guess. Normally I am almost never affected by something like this, but for some reason, i was affected by this product.  So you just have to try it for yourself and see how it affects you, and if you do not have any negative effects, then the next question would be, ""Did it actually make my hair start to grow back,"" and many people have said that it did.Since I could not use this, I then remembered what I used to do that caused my hair to grow to be very long, and I have begun to do that again.  I would not put that down here, because you must know what you are doing in order to do this safely.

2023-05-19,True,3,"This is a weird product...First, a bit of a backstory: I'm a woman who has started losing her hair about 5 years back and I've been looking for a supplement that can HELP with growing it back. I've tried Viviscal, multivitamins with biotin, all without success. So I decided to try this; it was nearly half the price of Nutrolol, what else did I have to lose?I took advantage of the first time deal of 3 bottles for the price of 1 and I'm done with the first bottle and I have some observations to share. Well, two major observations.Expect more hair shedding, at least for the first week or two. I've read this is completely normal to expect, as the new hairs start coming into the shafts.Also, when I first started taking this, my body wasn't used to these and I was mentally drained, even after full nights of sleep. It could also be because I wasn't taking these with food, like it's recommended.One minor thing I want to bring up that's probably common sense is that eating quality protein (not from ramen, like I like) can go a long way in how this benefits YOU. Since hair grows an average of an inch a month, don't expect miracles with this, or you're probably going to be let down. Since I'm only in one month in, I can tell that some existing hairs are a bit longer.After I'm done taking all three bottles, I'll update this review. I'm consciously optimistic about these supplements, though.",1271,287,Health Supplements,4.3,,1,0.0001

The pills are also quite large, ok for me but others maybe not.They do have a strong smell and taste which I got used to.While the product did stop my hair shed it cost more than the brand I used previously and I received the same results so I have switched back.I also received the free bottle from the company after I purchased from Amazon, with no problem.

I saw the promotion on Facebook, buy one get 2 free with Amazon order number, so I decided to jump on it and give it a try.

Taking biotin also wasn’t doing anything for me either.I know how disheartening it can be to have to read though all the lies of sooo many products that are out there.What I’ve noticed in the past month taking this religiously is that there’s been a-lot less shedding and my hair is definitely growing faster then it was without it, but not thicker.

2022-08-19,True,2,"Edit 8/24/22- I raised my review to 2 stars instead of 1 because of their customer service. They reached out to me and gave me a full refund, which I very much appreciate. I was right about the product though, and the bad symptoms I was having pretty much went away instantly after stopping these. I have a little bit lingering, but I think it’s because I need more time to heal and it’s only been 5 days since I stopped taking them. Even the dry skin and itchy scalp has improved. Looking into the ingredients more, I believe the culprit is l-cysteine HCL. This is a chemical compound using hydrochloric acid and soluble salt of cysteine to create a synthetic version of the non essential amino acid l-cysteine. While I believe that ingredient has merit in certain applications, too much can cause those same upper GI symptoms that I (and others here) was having; especially if you’re prone to them. It’s likely also the source of the foul smell. I believe the company is using too much, and since it’s part of their proprietary ingredients we don’t know how much they use.Original review 8/19/22- Over the last year or so I have tried several different hair growth supplements. I mainly just  wanted to stop the shedding that was getting really bad. I started out with Nutrafol; which worked at first then stopped for some reason. I kept trying, but as it is an expensive product and didn’t appear to be helping, I moved on. I tried NueCo and didn’t think it was working. Toward the end of my second month though I started noticing a difference. Problem is I had already ordered these, so I decided I’ll go ahead and try them and see if maybe they can at least continue the progress I had seen from NueCo. Over the last couple weeks I have been getting crazy symptoms that I chalked up to GERD and/or stress from being on call at work and not getting enough sleep. However it has gotten so bad, I was really starting to get worried that maybe it was my heart disguising itself as GI which can happen; especially in women. I have NEVER had cardiac issues and as a matter of fact, my ticker is always considered to be in amazing health. Then I thought maybe the GERD/small hiatel hernia/Barrett’s esophagus I was diagnosed with last year had suddenly taken a turn for the worst. Prior to this recent onset of symptoms, I was having very little to no issues with said diagnosis. Also my scalp has been super itchy, which is not usually an issue. In general, my skin has suddenly been much dryer as well, which I had FINALLY gotten to a point of looking and feeling hydrated. I’ve been racking my brain wondering what the heck it could be?! Was it just life/age catching up to me? (I’m 48) Something made me come here and look over these one star reviews and here are people having the EXACT same issues! Weird thing is, I usually do look at one star reviews before buying something new; especially a supplement, so I’m not sure how I missed it with these! Plus as many others have said, they smell AWFUL! I will absolutely not be continuing with these and will get rid of the rest of the bottle that I have. If for some reason  it turns out not be these, I will update my review. However considering when I started taking them and the onset of symptoms, I am confident these are the problem. I just hope they didn’t cause permanent damage. I will spend the money and go back to NueCo or Nutrafol.",447,116,Health Supplements,4.3,,6,0.0001

But I started noticing that I was starting to notice E.D. problems during sex, and it was getting worse. I did some research and found this is a common problem with Finistade, which is also in this product. I stopped using both this product and Finistade pills. Since then (a few weeks ago) our sex life has done a 180 and is back to good. I have started using PuraDor shampoo and it seems to be helping. I found out that the Head and Shoulders shampoo I'd been using for 18 months contains formaldehyde which has been found to kill off hair follicles, so that may have caused a lot of the loss.

I have had Covid and I have read and heard from many others that post covid hair fall is one of the side effects.The pills do have a strong odd smell not sure what causes that and it makes swallowing the pill somewhat unpleasant I close my nose before I swallow and avoid a feeling to puke.

2021-01-16,True,1,"I am pushing 50, and noticed that my hair has been thinning and the growth slowing over the past few years.  I have fine, thin, straight, color-treated blonde hair.  I used to be able to grow my hair long, but haven't been able to get it much past my shoulders recently.  I stopped color treating my hair in hopes that it would help my hair grow, but I didn't notice any improvement.  To add insult to injury, I noticed a decent amount of hair in the drain after every shower.  My hair was falling out in a quite noticeable way, and my self-esteem was slipping.I began looking for something that might help.  I didn't want to use a topical solution.  I found FoliGROWTH here on Amazon, and checked out the reviews.  I was skeptical, but figured that I'd try a bottle out, hoping to obtain even some sort of minimal result.I've been taking 3 pills of FoliGROWTH daily for two weeks now.  My hair is so fine that it's difficult to even see any baby hairs, so I have no idea if improved growth is happening or not yet.  But I will say this:  My hair has STOPPED FALLING OUT!!!!  I kid you not.  I know this because before taking these supplements, I would remove a small handful of hair from the drain after every shower.  It was always a depressing experience.  Now after each shower, there is hardly any hair in the drain at all.  I counted four hairs today.  FOUR!  I am THRILLED!!!!So does this stuff work?  Looks like it does!  After two weeks, my hair has stopped falling out in clumps.  If this is the only thing that happens with these supplements, I'll gladly take it!  I'll update my review in a month or so to share my results.  But at this point, consider this skeptic totally convinced!SEVEN MONTHS LATER...I'd been using Foligrowth since January 2021.  The most recent bottle has a considerable formula change!  It now smells awful, like something died and was sealed inside the bottle.  I checked the Supplement Facts, and I see that the amounts of Riboflavin (previously 50mg, now 20mg), Vitamin B12 (previously 100mcg and now 75mcg), and Pantothenic Acid (from 300mg to 50mg) have been reduced.  And the pills look somewhat different now.Since I am paying the same price, I expect to receive the same product, as I'm sure the changes affect the supplement efficacy.  When I first began taking Foligrowth, my hair completely stopped falling out entirely. It was amazing!  But with this new formula, my hair has reverted back to falling out like it did before I started taking Foligrowth. Very, very disappointed!",802,281,Health Supplements,4.3,,803,0.0001

If you are like me spending hours reading through reviews to see WHEN we can see some type of goodness, then continue reading.I'm on day 14 of Dht blocker and folligrow, and day 4 of the serum. It's too soon for any growth update, but the shedding has drastically reduced. I take them as directed minus with food in the morning as im not hungry at 7am. 15 days ago, my shower drain would be hair clogged within minutes of getting in the shower, now the hair in the drain is about a quarter of what it was. 15 days ago I would brush my hair or run my fingers through it and I would hair hair covering my shirt, the floor, counters, brush/hands, everything. Today, only a few hairs in the brush. I'm very hopeful this product will help.My only issue so far is that if I do take the pills in the evening (5pm or later) I notice I can't fall asleep. I do not drink anything with caffeine in it after 10am anymore so I know it's nothing I'm drinking causing this and the only thing new are these pills. I am currently experimenting with the times I take the second set.I have recently tested my thyroid and found it's very underactive again which is likely causing my hair loss (plus perimenopause). I will keep taking these along with the two other products and update this review at the 30 or 45 day mark.I hope this review helps others looking for signs of hope. I wish more people would leave longer detailed reviews on things like this.30 days: technically 29 but nothing major will happen overnight LOLI stopped the serum for now because of two things- it's winter and it's super dry in my house so I don't want to wash my hair everyday and have to blow dry it. Kind of defeats the purpose of what I'm doing, and I started red and nir light therapy around day 17.  It looks like my wispy short hairs (either breakage or new from before starting this) are getting longer. Shedding is unbelievably less than ever. Like it's been YEARS since I've experienced ""normal"" shedding. LOL I just woke up and I'm a crazy sleeper. I took my sad, thin little braid out and brushed my hair and there were zero hairs on my shirt and a couple in the brush. My skin looks nicer. Haven't gotten my normal hormonal cystic acne this month but do have a few tzone breakouts - which I normally don't get.I woke up to a lot of dandruff/skin turnover this morning but it could be because I skipped my dandruff shampoo this week. When I blow dried my hair last night, there were a few hairs on the ground, but nothing like before. A month ago, I was like a dandelion in the wind lolBecause of all this, I leave my 4 stars. It stopped the shedding, y'all. I mean... that right there is impressive and awesome in itself.I'll be back in a month!**47 days.While my hair is not shedding as stated above, my period this time around lasted 12 days. Mostly spotting but I had to do AM pills only for a week in order for the spotting to stop (foligrow and dht blockers). Idk which one caused the extended bleeding if either of them did. I've also noticed that these seem to constipate me a bit. I thought I just had to get used to them but when I lowered the dose my BMs were more frequent again. Now I'm back too tiny to no BMs, then clogged, then a full day or two of stomach aches and bathroom runs. Sigh. I have another period coming up this week. If I bleed longer again, I will have to cut back both and hope it doesn't mess up my progress.My hair does seem fuller (to me) and is growing in length quicker it seems. I honestly don't think I see new growth, but I do have hairs ranging from a quarter inch to half inch all over the top of my head. I feel these may just be breakage hairs growing out? I would think any NEW growth would be just starting to pop out now or soon.**60 daysStopped dht blocker a few days ago due to  excessive bleeding. I'm still taking the foligrow vitamins and I'm hoping it's enough to keep the hair growth. Within the last week I've really noticed a ton of 1cm hairs all over my head. I uploaded a photo of my part and I feel like there's a pretty decent difference in the two. My hair feels thicker and looks fuller. Fingers crossed the vitamins are enough to keep the growth going.",2394,1063,Health Supplements,4.3,,271,0.0001
2023-06-21,True,4,"This is my second review. My first review I had only been using this supplement for a month. I am now on my 3rd month of using this product. I can say that this product does make new growth come in pretty quickly. (3 months is quick for someone who has tried everything.) It stimulates new hair growth that is strong. I also do not lose as much hair in the shower anymore. I would lose it by the handfuls. This product will not heal already damaged hair, split ends, or broken hair shafts, but the new hair growth will be strong and thicker. I will keep using this product and next review I will post pictures of before and after 6 months of use.",2394,1063,Health Supplements,4.3,,21,0.0089
2023-06-22,True,4,"I am pretty bad at taking supplements. So I got off to a slow start on this because I always forget to take them. I made a concerted effort to take them for over 4 weeks now and today I noticed that there was a bunch of small spout hairs on top of my head. I hadn't seen them because my hair is fine anyway but the light hit just right and there they were. I've also noticed some volume if it were as well. I've found less hairs on my bath room counter and in the sink. Holy smokes. I usually think products like these are hopeless, but I think we have a winner!",2394,1063,Health Supplements,4.3,,11,0.001
2023-07-02,True,4,"Initially bought this in green, was expecting an emerald green but it is more of a tree green so I returned for the black color. The style is great and fits really well (size 12/14, ordered XL). Asymmetrical neck line stays in place and overall love the lines and style. If it was a better material I would give it 5 stars. It’s very thick and heavy and although this is for a fall wedding, I imagine getting very sweaty and uncomfortable throughout the night. If you’re not affected as much by fabric quality this dress is great. Not sure if I will keep it.",386,78,Womenwear,4.2,,10,0.0007
2023-06-11,True,4,"I ordered this dress at the last minute since the dress I originally ordered no longer fit my expanding preggo belly. I was worried that last minute meant no time for alterations but once it came in I was blown away. It fit me perfectly! Minus the length but hey, that’s short girl problems and nothing a nice pair of heels didn’t fix. The material was perfect with a slightly thicker quality to it especially since the wedding we attended had a cooler temperature and the ceremony was outdoors. But nonetheless it was great! I loved the stretchy quality to it as it gave my belly room and was perfect for when it was time to hit the dance floor. I would definitely recommend this dress!!",386,78,Womenwear,4.2,,25,0.0012
2023-04-12,True,4,"The dress is beautiful, but will hide nothing. I am 5' 9"" and typically wear an XL in other clothing and bought an XL in this dress. I feel like the sizing is right on point, but I would never wear it without shapewear. I also have thicker arms, and I found the sleeves to be a bit tight. I also felt like I was adjusting the neckline the entire night. All that said, when everything was in place, I felt beautiful and received many compliments. I especially love the back--it is so pretty and gives a ""low-back feeling"" without showing back fat.Overall, it has a great price-point for how formal it looks, travels well, you can wash it normally and hang dry and it's good to go, and because of the neckline you can wear it a couple different ways.",386,78,Womenwear,4.2,,25,0.0006
2023-04-08,True,4,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I originally purchased this, but it was amazing! I got so many compliments on it when I wore it. It's a thicker, more supportive material, and fit snuggly. I added a little detail myself with a wedding belt to give it a little pizazz. Only downfall to this dress it that is snags easily, and it's not a type of material that can be fixed. So this dress is kind of a one and done kind of deal. But it was worth it for the one night at a gala. I added photos of where you can see the pulling. But it likely wouldn't be too noticeable if worn at night again. But overall, great dress! I wore a small,  5ft tall (wore tall heels otherwise too long), 113lbs",386,78,Womenwear,4.2,,38,0.0003
2023-02-22,True,4,"Fit is perfect. Probably could size down if I was super confident, probably up if I wanted more drape.I like the material, which is stretchy and soft, and wrinkle-resistant. Seams are a little obtrusive but soft enough that they don’t cause discomfort. Quite long on me, with heels the back still hits the ground.It isn’t designed to look right off one shoulder; the zipper in the back will pull sideways and look odd. Like rather than going from your tailbone to the base of your neck it will go toward the shoulder weirdly.If worn off both shoulders, it pulls tight and pushes against my throat.In short: for the price, it’s not bad at all. It’s something that can be thrown in luggage for a night out without needing to worry about steaming or anything, and it appears you can just throw it in the wash with regular clothes so that’s nice. I’ll be using this as a “date night” dress when we travel.On my body, I believe it would look best with shape wear that goes from knees to under bust, as this is the area it is clingiest.

2023-02-07,True,4,"I needed a last minute floor length gown for the Grammys (I was a Seatfiller.) I didn’t want to spend hundreds of dollars for one night  but I wanted to look it! This fit the bill. It was comfy (felt like I was wearing joggers-comfortable!). It has a beautiful satin-sheen look, thick and stretchy. Flared and fitted in all the right spots. I’m a size 8 in most dresses but sized up in a large because of my curvier bottom. Because of the stretch, by the end of the evening, the shoulders straps got loose and wouldn’t drape. It stretched out in all the places. I should’ve stuck to gmy Medium size! Loved the dress and already purchased it in a size medium in another color.",386,78,Womenwear,4.2,,15,0.0005
2023-01-02,True,4,Material- very good quality not sheer or thin. Has a Stretch to it but still fits in the right areas. I ordered an XL due to curvy hips and it worked out great with shape-wear to smooth it out. I could have downsized to a large but hip area would have been too tight. I was able to slip it on without unzipping it. That the Stretch it has.  The length is exact with a 3 inch heel. I did pick the dress up slightly when walking only to keep from slipping. It can be one shoulder or both depends on how you want to wear it.,386,78,Womenwear,4.2,,12,0.0008
2022-09-14,True,4,"I bought this as a mother-of-the-bride dress for my daughters wedding in December. It is a beautiful dress and the material is heavy and thick but stretches in all the right places for a good fit. The length was perfect for my heel height in the shoes I was planning to wear. I am 5’2” and 165 pounds. I ordered a Medium and it fit perfectly. Also, I added a decorative belt that I bought at David’s Bridal to glam it up and it really did make the dress more formal.I gave this dress 4 stars only because the material of the dress snags very easily and causes puckering. Some materials you can stretch and toy with it to get snags out but that didn’t work in this case. I do love the dress and will keep it to wear for any other events in which I go.",386,78,Womenwear,4.2,,40,0.0004
2019-09-16,True,5,Was pleasantly surprised of the nice packaging cute paper box it came in. Their a bit big not really huggie and in my opinion not suitable as a gift for young girls and not for anyone with small ears. I myself have relatively  big ears they suit me wonderfully.  They remind me of my mother as the design is an 80's style retro feel that i absolutely LOVE. Classic design that will never go out of style . Very sturdy i shower with them i where them all the time and take them off each night as they are a bit big so not very comfortable to sleep in but possible - i did sleep with them twice and it did not bother me. If your buying them as a gift you will need some sort of paper gift rap. All and all great for the price very happy with them !,553,112,Jewelry,4.1,,14,0.0001
2020-10-12,True,3,"I bought this suit for my sisters wedding. The suit jacket is too small.  The pants fit a little snug as well.  My son is 7 years old and he's a little husky so I ordered the 10 year old size, and it's still tight. I read the description and it does say slim fit, so I call myself going up a size. The quality was good, I actually thought it was going to look cheap but it wasn't.  The price was not bad, for that kind of suit. I  sent it back for the next size. Hopefully it will be back 🙏 before the wedding.",41,11,Kidswear,4.4,,1,0.0284
2019-08-08,False,3,I don’t feel “slim fit” is an accurate description. This item was purchased for me in a size 14/160. I normally wear a boys 16 in pants (26” waist” and the pants that arrived were easily a 29” waist and very loose fitting throughout the leg. The waistband is very odd which made it difficult to tailor as well. The jacket fit well from neck to just under armpits then ballooned out at the bottom. Partially removed the lining and what was underneath was a mess. I was luckily able to save the fit but it required some serious tailoring on my part.,41,11,Kidswear,4.4,,1,0.0011
2021-07-31,True,2,"Tuxedo came used and just thrown in the bag. There are stains on the tux velvet blazer. It was most definitely worn, returned to Amazon and back out to me when I placed the order. I will return and buy again in hopes to get a new tux for my son. If this happens again, I will update this review not to purchase. Crossing fingers I get a new tux for my sister’s wedding next month. Geez. Overall, the fit  was decent and fair. The pants were longer than expected, but I’ll get them tailored to fit more. Tux pants do not have adjustable waist loops inside of the pants like most toddler pants do. So they fit really baggy in the waist and crotch. My son will need a belt or I’ll get taken in a bit in the waist. The 5T fits my son who’s 50 lbs and wears average size 6/7 in most clothes. The 5T runs a little big in my opinion. This tux came with a box tie as well, but no shirt.",12,5,Kidswear,4.4,,9,0.0004
2023-05-16,True,5,"Ok so previous to ordering this for my son I was confused and unsure because the reviews were all over the place! From sizing quality etc. I am here to tell you that the quality is phenomenal! The blue is such a gorgeous blue! My heart is broken because I ordered a “12 years” for my son who is 5’1”, 118 lbs and 11 years old. It fits but just a little too snug to be able to wear comfortably. It looks like it fits tailored but he can’t raise his arms and the pants are too snug although they do button 😭 the size “14 years” is out of stock and now I have to find something else for him to wear to his 5th grade “prom”.

As much as I'd like to rate it a 5 (because it fits my son soooo well) I can't.The pant has a hole in the knee, the neck tie looks like it has been worn several times and the red bowtie is missing.For $135 this is absolutely unacceptable. I tried exchanging it and it says ""none available"" so I had no choice but to return it. Came to order it and it shows they have ONE available... Hmmm 🤔 is it the one, I'm returning?

I stitched up the seams to use for another performance and after the second performance more seams opened up.I love the style, the color, the look, everything about this suit, but it is cheaply made and the jacket just does not hold up to simple careful wear.  I would imagine if this were worn for a wedding, by midday the jacket would be embarrassingly ripped open in multiple places. Its that delicate and poor quality in its construction.

These have held up and are still in good condition and they obviously do not scratch my ninja pans which is a plus because using metal is a no no with those pans. These are better than the cheap plastic and wood that Walmart has. I didn’t read if they are dishwasher safe but I hand wash only these and they still are great and are very sturdy for my cooking.

2023-01-29,True,3,"This product is exactly as it says. It's a silicon utensil set with holder. I got the white set. A few things about this set.1. They absolutely DO stain! Even though they say they don't.... 2 of my spoons are now orange lol. I expected it, however, they claim they don't stain. If you know this going into the purchase you'll be fine.2. The handles are great but the spatulas aren't as rigid as they should be. Everything from the spoons to the turners have a rigidity to them with a tiny bit of flexibility that makes them amazing to use. However, the spatulas are more soft and almost flimsy where they should be slightly rigid. It just needs a tiny bit of modification to make it better.3. The storage ""cup"" for the utensils is almost too small. To fit all of the utensils in it, they have to be put in a certain way. When you go to pull 1 out, multiple try to come with it. The cup needs to be about 1/2 inch bigger and it would be perfect!To sum things up.....This set is fairly nice. Great addition to anyone's kitchen or a great gift for someone who loves to cook. With a few tweaks it could be well worth the $40. As it is, it's worth about half of that.",832,142,Kitchenware,4.5,,5,0.0001

It was short in height that utensil holder and beyond cheap. Some of the pieces came covered in plastic. Unwrapping those and the smell hits. A chemical odor for sure. Unsure what? Did note in the listing that a buyer is asked to wash and soak items to dispel that. Strange. Noted not all handles are flush and sealed well to their silicone parts. One handle I noted was damaged on the slotted spoon. Unless company can replace only a few pieces, which I doubt they can or will, I need to return entire set.

If you are soaking a pot and toss them in the pot to soak as well, the wood handles will become very rough and uncomfortable to use. They also become weak where the wood meets the silicone- making them feel wobbly. The box it comes in says “dishwasher safe” on one side and on the other says “not dishwasher safe” and “do not soak”. Even though it says not to soak- it’s just difficult to completely avoid them coming into contact with water. Even using them in a pot of boiling water/liquid- you’d need to avoid letting the wooden handle come into contact with the liquid. Just not practical.",289,96,Kitchenware,4.5,,1,0.0002

2022-01-15,True,3,"This is a basic set, I’ve had it for more than a year now. The silicone part will eventually separate from the wooden handle. I have had to reglue them together several times (different ones). The one thing that didn’t last long at all was the pastry brush, the strands started separating from the base within a few uses. A metal whisk works better than the silicone one, i don’t even touch the silicone one anymore as it is not as strong and does not scrape the bottom of the pot as i need (to minimize burning while making beshamel). Over all it’s a decent set to use like for college students but I wish i got a better set for at home long term use. There is one utensil that I absolutely love but it’s wearing down. These don’t stain easily but they may discolor eventually with lots of high heat cooking. I am now looking for a new set, although this set has served me well, i need a higher quality set.

2021-05-26,True,3,"The reviews about an intense chemical smell out of the box are correct. It's probably from the paint/dye/colorant in the silicone. So I decided to try and remedy that before using.1) Off-gassing. I let all of the untensils sit out in the garage for 24 hours, standing up in the holder.2) UV, I left them in direct sunlight, rotating a couple of times, for just an hour or two. Then I took them out of the sun and put them back into the garage to cool and continue to off-gas until that evening. Too long in the sun and the glue might melt so I didn't want to take that risk.3) hand washNot much science involved in this, but it definitely helped oxidize and off-gas any of the scent because it could not be detected afterwards.Got about a month on them all so far, will probably need to reglue the whisk.

Also, the ""crock"" they came with is just a little plastic cup with holes in the bottom.

I did treat them all with coconut oil when I first received them but I guess that wasn’t good enough. I’m not really sure how to take care of them.

2018-02-27,True,4,"As one who is in the planning stages of writing his own book, I'm interested in all the advice I can get regarding the self-publishing and marketing of a book on Amazon. So, I was quite naturally intrigued by John Spencer's short, free article in Kindle Book form entitled ""Get 1,000 Readers for Your Self-Published Book."" There's an old saying, you get what you pay for, but, in this case, Spencer imparts some good advice and some sound strategy.""Get 1,000 Readers"" is not Book Marketing 101; it's not even an Introduction to Book Marketing 101. It's probably best to think of this as an introduction to an introduction. In length and tone, this work is about what you would expect to find in a brief introduction to a marketing book, written in a light, breezy tone that still manages to make the author's points.The author has asked reviewers not to reveal his strategy, so I won’t, but anyone looking for a detailed marketing strategy (if, for some reason, they expected to find this in a “book” that’s about ten pages long) will be disappointed. However, the author is really trying to make a point, actually two points, through the book and the strategy he describes. These two points are very basic, but, from my own experience as a reviewer, there are a number of beginning writers and would-be writers for whom these points haven’t sunk in, and some of them might pay a good bit of money for some other author to dress these points up in about a chapter of verbiage that accomplishes the same thing as Spencer offers for free in ten pages. Most people will finish “Get 1,000 Readers” in about five minutes and then re-read it to make sure they haven’t missed anything. And then, my hunch is that most readers will remember these points for quite a while, even though they probably won’t remember the source.John Spencer appears to be a rarity in the self-help realm on Amazon. He’s offering something for free, not as a come-on to more comprehensive (and more expensive) marketing and publishing assistance, but, simply, to impart some wisdom (he has other books for sale on Amazon, but they are in unrelated fields). Most real beginners will eventually need these other types of resources, but Spencer’s advice is something that is worthwhile from the very start.",28,9,Books Nonfiction,3.5,3.2,2,0.0001

It ran a little big, which was quite disappointing as it didn't provide the desired fit.

The Napfun memory foam gives just enough to mold to your body, and the position that you are assuming in your seat. The MLVOC is stiffer and may be better at holding a head up and keeping it from falling on your chin, but I did not like how thick it felt on the back of my neck. This is my initial take.....we will see after my 10 hour flight using the Napfun!  I think it is a great idea to compare both and make your own decision.",2572,288,Travel,4.3,,2,0.0166
2022-06-19,True,3,"For quite awhile now I've been using what I considered to be a standard travel pillow, the type that I've seen in use in planes or movies filmed in planes, with people using them for support and comfort. In fact that was the only style I'd ever been aware of until it came time to replace my well used and no longer supportive neck pillow.To be fair, I did see one or two that had the shape I was used to, but each had filling that I feared would shift from being evenly distributed to residing only at either end, leaving the middle of the pillow with no support.  This is what happened to mine, so I was leery of replacing it with another that may be prone to the same failure.There were a LOT of choices available when I looked for a replacement and, in my defense, I think I can claim that my brain shut down after looking at and reading about each one, which took quite awhile.I certainly can't say I couldn't see the obvious differences and should have realized that it would in no way fit or give the support I was used to.  Also, it was one of the least expensive models listed and used one piece of memory foam for its filling so I knew the support for my head would remain constant.I can't really complain about the fit, I was shown a picture of exactly how it would fit  I just didn't expect it to be so large.  The sides come up and over my jaw  and I can see that as a good thing in some circumstances and I'll probably stop noticing it eventually.  The head support is both thicker and higher than a 'normal' neck pillow, forcing my head forward rather than allowing me to relax back into it.Overall I'm sure that this would not be a bad choice if you were on a plane with a window seat.  Unfortunately that isn't what I needed it for and I probably didn't put enough time into researching for my replacement.",2572,288,Travel,4.3,,8,0.0002

I'm 6'1 and felt like I could have used more support in the front of the pillow.  Overall though, it was great and if I have to do another red eye flight I'll definitely bring it along.

We actually purchase this travel pillow for my wife, but it wasn't exactly what she wanted, so I took it over.I have tried several different kinds of travel pillows and the MLVOC Travel Pillow has been the one that has helped me get decent sleep. It is very comfortable and supportive. The inclusion of eye covers and earplugs in the kit may offer value for some, but it's not something that I would want to use. I use ear buds with music when I am trying to sleep on a plane and have never liked eye covers.It is difficult for many people to sleep sitting up as you do on an airplane but this pillow certainly helps. It keep your neck from falling too far to the side or the front and the improvements to the back of the pillow make it easier to keep your head leaning back.If you have a smaller neck and have a phobia about something being tight around the front of your neck - this may not be for you.

It supported my neck and kept me from leaning on an unsuspecting neighbor. The material was comfortable and didn't seem to hold heat. I was worried it would be bulky or annoying as I moved from terminal to terminal, but if you roll and squish it into the bag it comes with, you won't even notice that it's attached to your carryon.

2023-02-25,True,5,"This memory foam pillow expands into a collar rather like a neck brace;. It's contoured in such a way that if your head lolls back, down or side to side, there is a cushion in place to prop up your noggin. A drawstring closes the horshoe into a cylinder around your neck.  Someone with a massive neck from bridging workouts on the football field might find it doesn't close around your chin but most people will find some chin support.This gets around the problem of a large donut and still gives very good support, in fact, better support than those pellet-filled horseshoes, and allowing you to store away the collar in a stuff sack, unlike those large memory foam donuts that are a bit bulky to carry around the airport with all your other hand luggageThe set also comes with an eyemask (it's ok, it is anatomically shaped but I prefer a more padded eyemask) and the usual orange earplugs. (And I use my earphones, so never mind about those either, but they do come in handy for noisy hotel rooms.)To get the large collar back into the stuff sack, you roll it up like a cinnamon bun and then taking one of the sides, stuff it in until you can cram the rest into the sack and cinch it shut. If you start from the side of the roll (not stuffing the top in first, by ""top"" I mean where you'd put the icing if it were a cinnamon bun) you'll manage to fit the fat roll into the sack for convenient carry.

It's just a very thin material that would lean like a jello and it's very very short that when I lean my head, I don't even feel it.I know I have a relatively long neck, but not to that extent.Again, desperately trying to find a use for it,I thought it might work for my 12 years old kid ""who wears size S or M for men"".

Overall I don't have a short neck and couldn't get it underneath and especially to provide any support going forward. Poor design, poor product. I'm unsure how it's gotten loads of 5 star reviews unless people just don't actually intend to use a neck pillow to sleep. A proper neck pillow shouldn't require being leaned against a wall/window, and you should be able to have full neck support will sitting upright. This pillow is not that.

For me, it didn't support where needed. I tried every bobblehead position: front chin drop, side neck bend, even head fully back (even though we know planes don't accommodate that); and it provided very little support. Also, the strap is sewn on completely wrong. I'm no seamstress/sewing person but the strap should be able to pull further to tighten this thing around your neck more. I think if it had that ability, a tighter fit would've been more supportive. But the strap adjustment is limited. You pull it as far as it can go and it doesn't go very far, it's not that tight. And there's no strap left for you to pull. Instead, the strap leaves a long tail that you can't fold or tuck anywhere, all without the tightness it should provide. It's like they sewed the buckle strap on too far over or too close. Hard to explain. Anyways, I went with the Cabeau TNE S3.

I did–I was traveling to Hawaii from the lower 48 and wanted a comfortable travel pillow that would actually keep my head up if I nodded forward (the most likely place my head would go if I fell asleep), so I bought two different brands just to make sure I got one that worked: this one (the ""MLVOC Travel Pillow"") & the ""Cabeau Evolution Classic Neck Support Pillow"" (and no, they didn't pay me to to give them a plug, but it didn't do what I'm showing in my photos here—absolutely no chin support— and I thought others might be interested in one that I know works for nodding forward when asleep, since I put a lot of effort into researching the different options available on Amazon and elsewhere).As the photos show, this pillow will not support you when you nod off forward. I had it tightened as far as it would go and it provided zero chin support. And I wasn't ""forcing"" my chin down–the space was already there. The Cabeau pillow, unlike this one, provided full support for my chin (it didn't come with the extra eye mask or ""stuff"" bag, but I already had my own for a sleeping bag that worked–it was easy to ""scrunch down"" the Cabeau pillow by rolling the pillow up from the side like a sleeping bag).So unless your neck is really wide to push the sides out & pull the front of the pillow in (I don't have a small head and my neck size is average for a male according to the google assistant search I just did–mine is 15½ inches in circumference), it won't provide you any support in the forward direction.",1030,254,Travel,4.3,,37,0.0018

I have to cinch it up and then it’s ridiculously uncomfortable. Cinch seems super cheap and like it will break without much use.

It moves in the right direction; (3) I think the battery life is good; (4) doesn't overheat like others; (5) good amount of memory; (6) camera quality is good and so is video for the phone; (7) I have not used the stylus much but when I do, I really like it. just the right amount of pressure.  some you have really press.  not with this.

I just turned them off.  to scroll up to press clear is a mess.  it is as if they want to force you to read them all.  the default is on so you may want to adjust setting to turn off and select the ones you want on.

I know it doesn't seem logical, but it is quite repeatable... with wifi off, the phone discharges at about 0.5%/hour (12%/day); with wifi ON, it is about 0.36%/hour (8.6%/day) ... That's the difference between 6 days and 8 days between charges.  I can't explain it, but it is definitely true! ]In the past, I focused on phones with removable batteries, so I could install larger after-market batteries to extend my run-time; the 10,000mAh battery in my LG V20 gave me about 9 days between charges, before that phone stopped working... that is comparable with what I get with the 5G's built-in 5000mAh battery.2. Pre-installed apps - this has been an on-going curse, especially with the miserable Samsung phones... My Moto G came with virtually *nothing* unwanted on it, and even the unwanted things that *were* installed (YouTube... and a couple others that I don't recall), I was actually permitted to uninstall, with no arguments!!  So there is no leftover garbage, pestering me to update... I am *ETERNALLY* grateful to Motorola for letting me remove what I don't want!!!3. voice reception is excellent... among the best that I've experienced, as good as any Samsung phone that I've used.4. Visuals (what the phone itself looks like) - not the most important issue, but the phone really *is* beautiful to look at!!  I've never actually cared about that with any previous phone.Cons:  [there really isn't much here]1. signal reception in remote locations... it is not quite as good at picking up weak signals as my Galaxy S5 was, but most other phones weren't superb with that either... it was one reason that I hung onto the S5 as long as I did... when I'm hiking in Sunol R.W. (Cal.), 10 miles outside the city, I rarely can pick up a signal, even from mountain tops... that's a bit disappointing, but as I said, typical of many other phones/services.

I couldn't have done the transfers without help from the Consumer Cellular phone tech at Target stores.  A huge plus.  Pure Talk may be a slightly better deal but CC's customer service is pretty knowledgeable and helpful when needed.  Battery (5000 mAh) started well but seemed to run down a little faster later, so 4 stars right now for it.  I'm not sure what happens to unused phone batteries over time.  But 2 days?

The batteries don't last forever, I've certainly gotten my money's worth out of the E4 Plus since July 2018 I've been waiting to find a 5G phone go on sale as my cell phone budget is under $200.00.  Thanks to Google (my phone data was backed-up to a Google email acct., which is typical) , after swapping in my SIM card (after consulting with my carrier, TING Mobile) the set-up and transition was rather easy. Photos loaded and my contacts transferred in automatically. I stayed with Motorola/Android because of familiarity and ease of use for me... I found the learning curve with my previous Moto E4 Plus to be easy enough and intuitive, this one is 90% similar in operation.

It has been a while since I used the android system anyway.  Set up was easy.  Used the cable.  All the apps worked (I don't use many, mostly auto locks, video and news media, etc.)  It set up with 5G Spectrum no problem but took about 45 minutes to fully operate.  I also had to restart three times to get a connection but don't know if it would have worked otherwise.  No big deal anyway.  This has a nice response, good screen, and acceptable performance.  Nice color and everything seems to work fine.  I like the ability to increase local memory with the scan cards.  Way cheaper than apple and you can take them out and plug into your local computer for very fast transfers and control.  Much faster than any other method for huge files.  The camera on this unit is fine.  Not State of the Art but hey this is not a pro camera anyway.  Want to do photos get the real thing.  This is just a nice machine for those daily snaps.  Seems we have gotten used to regular photos so this is OK.  One thing after having a small frame phone like the SE2022 this thing is huge.  It really doesn't fit anywhere.  And the screen use seems made more to get more on it than it does to make things larger and more readable.  The messages font seem to match the screen.  Very small or too large.  Just like the smaller phone.  The photos are nice, larger.  I bought this in ""acceptable"" condition, used saving about 260 from the list price.  It is worth it.

2023-07-30,True,5,"I recently purchased the Perilogics Universal Airplane in Flight Phone Mount for my travels, and I must say, I am quite impressed with its performance. This phone mount is specifically designed for airplane use, and it lives up to its purpose.The installation process was effortless; it securely attached to the airplane seatback without any wobbling or difficulty. The mount is adjustable, allowing me to find the perfect viewing angle for my phone. I particularly appreciated the sturdy construction, which held my phone firmly in place throughout the entire flight, even during turbulence.The Universal Airplane in Flight Phone Mount is compatible with various phone models, which is a great advantage for those who frequently switch between devices. The mount securely holds my phone, preventing any accidental slips or falls. Additionally, it does not obstruct any of the airplane's controls or buttons, ensuring convenience and ease of use.What impressed me the most about this phone mount is its versatility. Not only can it be used during flights, but it can also be utilized in other settings, such as on trains or buses. This makes it a practical investment for frequent travelers.Overall, I highly recommend the Perilogics Universal Airplane in Flight Phone Mount. Its solid construction, versatility, and secure grip make it a reliable companion for any traveler. Whether you need to watch movies, read e-books, or simply keep your phone within reach, this phone mount ensures a comfortable and enjoyable flying experience.",10159,1297,Travel,4.6,,6,1.0
2023-04-12,True,5,"This is a very versatile clip. The part that holds the phone rotates 360 degrees, and tilts. It also swivels 360 degrees, allowing you to position the phone in either portrait or landscape orientation.You can use this as a tabletop stand, though it's unsteady in portrait orientation with an iPhone Pro Max because the design of the clip leaves the center of mass of the phone pretty far up and horizontally offset from the base of the clip. It's stable in landscape orientation.It's very flexible when clipped on to something else. For example, it can be used in either landscape or portrait orientation for continuity camera with an Apple Studio Display. (In case you're wondering why one would do this: Your iPhone will produce a much better image than the webcam built in to the studio display, and the background blur feature works much better.)  The only drawback there is that the bottom of the clip will extend beyond the bezel , so you'll get a little occlusion of the top of your screen.If the back of your monitor is curved, that can introduce a few additional challenges. You may need to orient the clip so your phone extends behind the monitor rather than in front of it.  Depending upon how the clip catches the back of your monitor, the offset from the monitor and angle of the phone might create some issues where the camera is recording the top of your monitor. In the worst case, this can throw off the focus.Another issue, which is not unique to this mount, is that vibrations on your desk from, e.g., typing can cause the camera to vibrate. This means that you can't type discreetly during Zoom calls with your camera on - people will know.It's also possible to use this as a continuity camera mount on a MacBook, but the size of the clamp relative to the bezels is huge, so you will get a fair amount of occlusion. As with other continuity camera mounts on MacBook screens, the weight of an iPhone pro max becomes an issue that limits how you can tilt the screen. Overall, it's not the best solution for a MacBook, but it is somewhat usable.I haven't tried this on an airline seat tray yet, but I'm optimistic that it will work as advertised.Despite the limitations I mentioned above, I'm confident with a high rating for this product. Why? No single mount will work perfectly in all situations. This one is better suited to some applications than others, but it is usable in a very wide range of situations.I'm definitely planning to put it in my travel bag.",10159,1297,Travel,4.6,,14,0.0001

It is able to bend/flip in almost any direction to accommodate the size of your phone in relation to the tray. It is very sturdy.

The screen protector collects so many fingerprints that it's difficult to see through.

What this means is if you are like me and want to preserve what little privacy these devices offer by choosing to disable the Find Your Phone feature, and you are unable to unlock the lock-screen with your PIN for any reason, your device is effectively bricked. Nokia support refuses to provide instructions or software that will allow you to restore your phone to factory defaults. Your only option is to ship your phone to a Nokia service center and hope they are slightly more competent than the support team. They claim this is because customers abused this functionality and bricked their own phones, and rather than making the process easier or safer they decided in their infinite wisdom that it would be a better idea to take that functionality, which is common on ALL mobile devices, completely away without disclosing this fact to new or existing customers. They appear to be completely ignorant of how utterly insane that decision is. Based on my experience with the Nokia ""customer care team"", not only will I never purchase another Nokia product again, I will be filing a complaint with the FTC.

Inside, multiple pockets keep items organized, including a dedicated space for water bottles.Whether I'm hitting the gym, going on a weekend getaway, or embarking on a business trip, this Gym Bag has proven to be my reliable, stylish, and functional companion",4276,604,Travel,4.5,,3,0.9999
2023-08-06,True,5,"I bought this bag last minute for a travel & it came the same day which was amazing. Fit everything I needed for a 5 day travel I like how you can put shoes on the bottom separate then where your clothes go. It's durable, so many little pockets which is nice, it fits under the seat in front of you.The only thing I can say that didn't work for me was the USB port. Not sure if I didn't charge it fully before I left but when I went to plug my phone in on the side the USB did not work so that was defiantly a dummer cause it's not always easy to find places to charge your phone at an airpot.Overall love the bag and all the compartments and the little bag that comes with it for your make up or anything else you want to use it for.",4276,604,Travel,4.5,,9,0.0001

This year I saw this bag listed as excellent for travel and I had a flight coming up and wanted to try this out. I ended up being able to check the bag planeside for free, but if I hadn’t, this bag would have fit under my seat or in the upper storage compartment easily. I’m very satisfied with the fabric, it repels a lot of stains even with the white color I went with. And the little bags it comes with are perfect for travel essentials and going through security. This bag is perfect for travel!",4276,604,Travel,4.5,,3,0.6446
2023-07-18,True,5,The feel of this bag surprised me. It’s very well made. I love that the inside pocket is water proof to prevent spills. The bottom is perfect for some shoes or in my case my electronics to make it easy to take out for security and throw back in. This is a great bag for travel. I bought it bc a tik tok said it fit the personal item requirements travel on planes and it does (in the medium) and this is perfect for how much I fly! I was hesitant because it’s a little more than I wanted to spend but I would do it again for each person in my household,4276,604,Travel,4.5,,5,0.0019

It has so many pockets on the inside and outside, plus a zippered compartment on the bottom for shoes. It even came with two drawstring shoe bags! I haven’t hooked up my power bank to use as a charger yet but it also came with the usb cord. The inner compartment is very well lined in case you have spills or wet items. I purchased the light cream color and I was worried that it would get dirty, but it really hasn’t.My only feedback is that I wished the bottom had a hard flat surface because if you have shoes in the bottom compartment, the bag won’t sit level if you stack it on top of your suitcase. I also wished the strap that slides onto your luggage handle was wider. Overall it’s a great bag and I’m glad I’m happy with my purchase!",4276,604,Travel,4.5,,18,0.8729

And packing this bag has made my trip prep so simple and easy. I feel freeeeeee!!!Hopefully I can use it for future weekend trips to come (in different colder weather seasons with bulkier items!)I’d only recommend the company to have more colors available for same day shipping- I would’ve totally ordered this in white and then after ordered in black… but I may just buy the white in the larger size.",4276,604,Travel,4.5,,15,0.0001

As many other people, I found it on TikTok/Insta and thought to buy it since many others seemed to like it…it came in today and upon first glance I was confused. Why was the bag two colours with pink being one of them when I ordered beige? Upon further inspection, it seemed to be poorly made and flimsy, not at all what the website photos told you. I decided to look at photo reviews and found it to be a common issue…of course, I haven’t tried it out yet and don’t know how fast the material would rip or how long it would last…but ide listen to the poor reviews and stay away. Better to buy a different bag from a different brand. Although in theory it was super cute!

I have to twist and wrap the straps around the handle of my roller bag for it to have any chance of staying put. This is not what you want to be dealing with in the TSA line.

Now I am not going to blame the seller or manufacturer on Delta losing my checked in bag for 24 hours or the black marring from checking it in..... what I will say is those stains did not come out of the fabric and zippers broke off (not Delta's fault).

2023-07-15,True,3,"The quality is impressive as are the numerous pockets, the charging port (which I haven't used yet), and the overall design. However, I would not consider it as a LARGE, 3-5 day WEEKENDER bag. I chose this bag, though in the large vs medium version, based on a cruise travel site recommendation. The various images on Amazon make this Weekender bag appear much larger than it really is. It is not large enough for a 3-5 day trip for me. Perhaps the marketing assumption is based on users being size 4-6 vs. more realistic sizes in the 12-14 range. The shoe compartment, while practical, reduces the main space if you have at least two pairs of size 10 shoes. The photos displaying the numerous pieces that should fit in the bag do not fit for me for 3-5 days of travel. My intent was to replace a similar bag with a larger one. In that respect, it only offers a fraction more space. If you need to fit sleepwear, lingerie, up to six interchangeable clothing items in size 14, a swimsuit, toiletries, bedroom slippers or flip-flops, along with two pairs of shoes (not including short boots) it will be tight. And, that doesn't include a tablet, cables, or any extras. My review does not mean it isn't useful ir if poor quality. It simply means this bag labeled as a LARGE WEEKENDER bag may not work for if you're size 14 or greater. My next trip is in in a  month. I plan to pack this bag in the next few days to see if what I plan to take will fit. I will submit a briefer, follow-up review after then.",354,57,Travel,4.5,,5,0.0017
2023-07-30,True,3,"I needed a same day delivery travel bag to use as my personal item for a flight. The bag arrived as promised and worked ok. Fully packed, though, it’s a tight squeeze under the seat in front of you and impossible if you are an aisle seat fan, like me. Thankfully, there was plenty of overhead bin space, so i had space for this and my carry-on suitcase.The bag itself is floppy with no structure. If you pack it full, no problem. But I prefer a more structured bag. You definitely need to fill the bottom zippered compartment to get any structure at all.The main compartment did hold my 13” Macbook Air (barely), but that made the bag too tall to slide under the seat upright. The bottom zipper part is too narrow for any laptop.Also, after just one transit through a single airport, the bag had a bunch of stains on it. I doubt I will use this bag for travel again, but as a one-time solution, it was ok.Overall rating = meh.",354,57,Travel,4.5,,1,0.0001
2023-08-03,True,3,"I traveled with this bag in the airport because a regular diaper bag wasn’t doing justice. But the only cons I saw was how it wasn’t water proof on the outside, like most diaper bags. I know this because I dropped my toddlers sippie cup on the bag by accident but not only was the bag soaked BUT also the items I had inside got wet (blankets, clothes etc.) And then depending what is put inside, it won’t sit up straight, it will constantly tilt and fall.-Do I still use it after the airport? Yes.-Is this worth the room for the price? Sure.-Am I the only one using this as a diaper bag right now? Maybe.Basically, it’s worth the purchase but the cons might be slightly annoying to some. But you can always keep this bag in your closet for whenever you feel like your diaper bag won’t hold enough. (Ex: Picnic days, pool days, trips etc.)",354,57,Travel,4.5,,1,0.0001
2023-05-24,True,3,"I wish I had read the critical reviews more. I probably wouldn't have bought it. First, the cream has a pink cast that doesn't match the trim and elastic, which are actually beige. The interior is gray, so there are three colors going on. The photo is definitely altered or misleading product quality. The bag is very shiny. The metal portions are rose gold and super shiny, so the whole effect comes off kind of cheap. The zippers feel like they will break easily. One of the pocket zippers is already separating in the middle. When you put shoes in the bottom, it can only fit one pair of running shoes (I wear a size 7). If they were low heels or ballet flats, maybe two pairs could fit. But with only one pair, the bag falls over. Also, it's not a structured bag at all as appears in the photo. With the top full and shoes in the bottom, it bends at the zipper, falls over and can't sit up very easily because the bottom of the bag is no longer flat and the top is heavier. Overall, I think the separate shoe storage is just a waste of space. They probably could have accomplished the same thing with a vertical internal divider. Probably returning this and buying from a regular retailer so I can actually see the quality first.",354,57,Travel,4.5,,4,0.0047
2023-07-18,True,3,"This bag is suitable for short travel that wouldn’t require too many shoes. It has great strap options and fully zips to keep your belongings safe. The beige color is lovely but probably isn’t great for the airport as it may dirty easily (haven’t tested that one myself).Not a fan of the logo plastered on it as I prefer a cleaner look. Lastly, I didn’t care for the zipper shoe storage on the bottom of the bag. My feet are small so with a full bag and shoes on the bottom it didn’t sit properly. The lack of structure and support of this bag is the biggest drawback.Overall it’s a decent béis dupe.",354,57,Travel,4.5,,0,0.0043
2023-04-24,True,3,"I purchased this bag for a recent week-long vacation. I needed a bag that I would be easy to carry and would coincide with my carry-on. For this particular trip, I packed carry-on only. I love that the bag came with additional shoe bags (x2) and cosmetics case, but was disappointed that it was smaller than expected. I was able to fit my toiletry and electrics cases in the lower zip compartment. The main compartment held my iPad, ear buds, cosmetics and other smaller items. Keep in mind that nearly 5 inches of this bag it takes up by the shoe compartment. The pockets on the exterior were small and did not zip, only Velcro. They were not deep so there was not much I could put inside. The side pockets were great for cleaning wipes and maybe a few other smaller items but that was it. While it is intended to be a pocket for a water bottle, a standard size water bottle does not fit because the pocket is not deep enough. I stored my water bottle inside the bag. The bag is well made with sturdy hardware, and I would presume, it's also washable (gentle cycle) if needed.

The little bag it comes with (once full) won’t fit in there. 2 pairs of tennis shoes won’t fit in the bottom compartment unless they are super flex.

It also comes with two drawstring bags for shoes so they don’t touch anything and another zip up bag for makeup it seems like (maybe toiletries???) The reason I gave it 4 stars is because I’m hoping they fix the shoe compartment. I think this bag would be flawless if you could zip up the shoe compartment if you aren’t going to use it.

2023-06-16,True,5,"This phone is huge and weighs in a good bit more than my last phone.  Battery life seems to be about the same as what I had.  Lots to be said about this phone.Camera is pretty dang nice.  There are some strange 'glitches' when it transfers between lenses.  Even though this is Android and I have been using Android, there is a ton to learn to use the camera.Screen is very clean and nice.Finger print reader  with a screen protector is kind of hit and miss.  The detectors is behind the screen.  Not sure how they work that magic but its kind of cool.  Make sure you set your pin first.Reception.  This seems to be pretty good on t mobile.  I was able to just take my sim card from my old phone and insert it into this phone... no need to go to the store to transfer the account.  Copied the data from my old phone using a usb cable in 10ish minutes.  No problems there.All the critical apps seem to be working like before.  Some needed to be re-setup.  Had to reconnect to our WIFI networks.Very disappointed that you cannot use a micro-SD card.  Especially when you see the price difference to get something like 1T of storage.  Its a bit ridiculous to have a 200 M pixel camera and not allow for user supplied storage.  In fact, its really really lame.The weight and size of the camera takes a bit to get used to.  Its only like an inch longer and 1/3 inch wider, but wow what a difference that makes.The speaker(s) are really good.  There is kind of a spatial sound on this phone.The phone is pretty fast for everything I have done, processor wise.The s-pen its really cool...i have been using it as a remote trigger for the phone.The phone surface is pretty slick (as in a little slippery) so I highly recommend a  case.Magsafe is a cool feature.  There is a magnetic attachment point over the wireless charging.  With the right case, you can do several things with this, like attach a second battery with no wires, just by placing it behind the case.  You can add a kick-stand, wallet, etc.Customization is pretty solid on the phone.  Seems like you can customize pretty much anything.Blutooth pairing is pretty simple and have had no problems here.Overall, this is a good phone.

It uses the snapdragon 8 gen 2 which appears to work perfectly for demanding tasks such as hard-core gaming , multi tasking or even multi windows running simultaneously,  I personally haven't experienced 0 lags or stutters. It also dramatically is better in terms of managing heat and maintaining battery life compared to the s22 ultra!▪︎security is top tier !! It's secured by Samsung Knox, has a secured folder, fingerprint reader(in screen) and facial recognition (along with all the other standard security options) the fingerprint works perfectly no issues.▪︎self diagnose,  the phone can self diagnose and test to make sure all the services are working properly.▪︎ it's a Samsung! With Samsung it offers so many features, including free on-demand and live TV with over 100 channels, it has loads of unique features and services, a few examples are Bixby which is both an assistant and a tool for automated tasks, you also get loads of automation with the device for various tasks to help make your device more convenient.The battery on this and heat management is top tier, it's actually on Apples battery type level and that says something,  there's so much to unpack and I hope to be able to explore it all eventually. This phone is definitely not for the weak, it's specifically a high-end phone meant to be used to the fullest.Only con: it has a 10mp front facing camera.  The s22 ultra camera was so good all around that I only used snapchats camera and never the actual stock camera, now that it's 10mp and not 40mp, it's noticeably different.  I think this is a major down grade regardless if it's stock camera benefits from this.There's much more to mention but that's what came to mind, over all if you're looking for a premium phone and want a high-quality device , this phone definitely gets the job done by far with no issues, I'd highly advise a phone case as this phone is not cheap.Love it!",370,72,Cellphones,4.7,,16,0.0001

2023-04-09,True,5,"One of the reasons I purchased this was for the 200mp camera. Although zooming in ultra close on a picture still has some jpeg compression artifacts, the overall image quality is great. It also has a raw mode which allows storage of picture files without compression.The other visual features are also impressive, video mode allows you to shoot in a variety of resolutions and frame rates, including up to 8k.Sound quality is impressive for a panel phone, and when watching videos with stereo audio information, the sound is actually reproduced by two speakers, one at the bottom, and the earpiece speaker, which adds more engagement when watching music or other videos.The phone sound quality is great, and is significantly better than most of the other phones I have used in the past.I have had a few minor issues with the face recognition, although if I add more variations (with sunglasses, or hats, etc.) I will probably have fewer issues. The display embedded fingerprint scanner is taking a little getting used to, but maybe re-registering the finger prints may help reduce those issues. The fact that fi get print scanning is possible on the display screen (as opposed to a dedicated scanner on the ba k or side of the phone) is another interesting feature, and is raki g me a little bit to get used to.I have only had older, reconditioned or renewed phones in the past, and have always been at least two to three years  behind the latest technology when purchasing a new phone. My last phone was at least 5 to 6 years since it was released. This is my first brand new, flagship phone, and although a bit pricey (for being an early adopter) I am pleased with the overall performance and features of the device. I am still learning about it, and finding new, neat little features that are not always a big selling point, but add to the 'wow' factor.I am very pleased with this device, and have protected it with an OtterBox defender case and a gel type screen protector, and in the month I have had it, I have enjoyed every aspect of it.",370,72,Cellphones,4.7,,16,0.0015

I had many options available to me but after hearing about the processor this phone has + the amazing camera I decided to take a chance with this. Boy I'm glad I did, setup was a breeze, navigation is simple, the phone feels solid, it's fast and feels great to the touch. I was disappointed that no charger came with it and no option for SD card. However there is plenty of space with the 500+GB. Also I purchased a 45w charger and it works great, charges fast. I will say this, unless you only want the phone for basic use the battery does drain a bit quicker than other samsung phones I've owned. Now onto the camera, as a photographer I am always looking for options other than a bulky camera, so when I heard the camera had up to 100x zoom I was enthralled. The picture quality is amazing but does suffer a bit with longer range zoom. The night view works great for taking pictures in low light environments.

It turns out that the phone is an amazingingly well engineered device that easily allows you to get rid of most of the Samsung apps.  The phone is light years better in T Mobile 5G performance and speed over the Oneplus 9 Pro.  The S23 hardware is solid.  The audio and video quality is excellent+, the networking is excellent+, the battery is way better than the OP9P, and NONE of my apps have had any problems working, the software is excellent too.  Its as if Android app developers test first on the Samsung phones to make sure they work (Just like Apple test theirs phones and apps)  With the OP9P, I would occasionally have the apps just refuse to work, not sure why.

2023-04-05,True,2,"I upgraded from a old s9 to this s23 ultra. So far I am injoying it. However, they missed the mark on a few things. First the fingerprint reader seems very slow. My s9 seemed much quicker and it never had an issue reading my print. The s23 has constant issues when unlocking the screen. I do not have a screen protector either so thats not the problem. Secondly it might not be a big deal to some but for a $1400 phone it amazes me that i have to download 3rd party apps to get basic features that my 5year old phone came with from factory.  For instance, when you get notifications while your phone is locked the screen does not light up. Its a pain having to pick up the phone and unlock it just to see what the notification is. I also had to download a second third party app to get the text to speach to work. Another thing im not a fan of is there are no leds on the phone at all. So if your phone is on silent, or you did not hear it you wont know if someone is trying to reach you unless you unlock the phone. Same with charging. No way to tell when the phone is charged without checking constantly instead of just looking over at the led. There is no option for external memory or a aux port for headphones. You have to spend extra money for cloud storage, and extra for an adapter to use the headphones. Speaking of witch, my base modle s9 came with samsung headphones, charging cable, charging block, and a screen protector for $600 less when it was new. This came with just the phone and a charging cord. All in all yes im happy with the phone but with its downsides i feel like 8-$900 would be much more reasonable pricing.Update: 3stars too 1..

Sometimes locking the screen then unlocking will fix it other times i have to do it 3 or 4 times before the screen starts working again. After phone calls im unable to hangup do to the same issue. The screen remains unlocked and on but the touchscreen refuses to work until you spam the lock button on the side multiple times.

Sure enough, another Samsung Ice Maker, the fingerprint sensor is in the middle of the blasted screen.I went through about 4 screen protectors and 3 cases until i found a combination that worked -ish.

I am starting to think Samsung's wisdom is that of Apple.5G was nice when I found it, but i can get a food stamp flip phone with that option.Basically I went with this not knowing about the fingerprint sensor after dropping my S9 into ammonia. If i had it to do over again i would keep my S9 away from large quantities of liquid and still be happy with my S9 or shop allot harder and looking closer at other android options before committing to another Samsung Ice Maker...

Tried transferring in smaller chunks.  Tried a factory reset.  Same problem.  Tried to continue copying the remaining uncopied files, but it would not proceed.  Found a few other people on reddit experiencing this.  Not sure what is going on.  Returned the phone as a result.  Considering whether to try another unit.UPDATE:  Ordered a replacement, but encountered the same problem.  So i believe it is a general phone issue with the S23 Ultra.  However, i decided to try the Smart Switch app to transfer my sizeable music library to this phone.  It worked.  It copied my library completely.

The s22u pics are true to color, e.g. carpet, wood tones, paint on the wall, etc.  I'll use an app if I want more vibrant color to pop in a photo, but I prefer ""true"" color rendition when the photo's taken. Also preferred the 22u selfies over the 23u's.  Not much else different between the models otherwise. 23u is a great phone for sure, but the pics were the dealbreaker for me.

2023-02-28,True,3,"Update: (3 stars still). Replacement arrived, screens felt slightly different. Placed carefully in pocket every time, and checked the phone after each withdrawal. For the first few times all seemed well; however, a few micro and I mean micro scratches appeared. You can't see them in standard light but if you look at it like a crazy person like I did (after the first phone's issues) you can see them. There is no way this phone would last a long time on it's own. Either samsung has some really bad quality control or I have to say the new glass is definitely a flop. I gave a family member my old s21 ultra already but I kind of wishing I had it as I really dislike the screen protector feel, but I don't think you can safely own this phone without one (or get lucky with quality control).The phone's battery has been fantastic though, much more efficient power wise. The photos are naturally very good as well (not that s21's were bad though). The phone is slim, the pen is nice (I used a phone case with a pen attached to it for my old 21 so I was excited to get it internal). The phone seems to process things quite quickly and things look as good and as smooth as you'd expect for the price (good).The material that seemed to cause the scratch was a synthetic like material that lined the pocket on some icebreaker shorts (merino wool company). Both my s21 ultras have been stored in this pocket before (which I've owned for multiple years). The previous phone I'm not sure which material caused it but it had many scratches that were visible from different angles. I don't wear blue jeans which have those metal buttons, I only wear slacks, cotton, and merino. I don't work in a sand pit either, so whatever scratched these phones was simply in the pocket out of the pocket (was never dropped). I even have my Note 10s, zero scratches.There is definitely something disappointing with their new glass. I've read some people say its because it's more shatter resistant so it's softer.. so I suppose if you're a phone dropper that might be good news, but I've never dropped my phone.. I'd rather be able to enjoy the premium screen feel with a scratch free screen.One note is the s21 ultra screens feel MUCH harder / smoother than the s23 ultra, which has a sort of soft squish and very very slight resistance.Amazon's customer service has been great and I would recommend buying phones from them- whichever phone you choose.If you were fine with your battery and camera, didn't need an upgrade, and had a sturdy phone then I'm not sure I'd suggest buying this as it's very expensive yet fairly fragile phone as it defeat's it's own luxury feel by requiring a screen protector (or luck of QC).If you're a screen protector free type person, then I don't recommend the phone, unless you're also into some gambling in which case buy the phone from Amazon so you can at least potentially replace it without a nightmare.Working with samsung on this is just an exercise in pain, though if they turn around somehow I'll update the review again.Previous Update: 3 stars- After talking to support for a third time they suggested to have Amazon replace it so I'm not out of a phone (and it's under the 15 day warranty). Amazon customer service was very quick and easy. Will update again for better or worse. Old review below.Old review 1 Star:Phone screen scratches easily, like put in and take our of your pocket. I've had a s21 ultra for multiple years and the screen looks brand new- not a single scratch at /any/ angle of light, there is no screen protector. The s23 ultra after a few /days/ has multiple micro abrasions that you can see at certain angles (like tiny scratches). I'm not one to put the phone in the same pocket as keys or just toss it in the bag either. Potentially a manufacturing defect, but Samsung support has been bad. Couldn't make a service request through their members system so I contacted chat who made it for me, arrived at the center they told me to go, they said they can't do anything for me because they don't have the screen and even if they did they wouldn't help because it's common scratching (... No way that is true, unless the glass is worse than s21..??).It's certainly a fast phone and the pen is neat, the functionality of the phone is great, I assume it's a good batch bad batch thing. Otherwise If the screen is actually weaker then the older phone then.. don't upgrade. If you're lucky it's probably great. :/",12,8,Cellphones,4.7,,39,0.0001
2023-07-28,True,3,First of all the phone is just too big to be practical & especially if you're a woman going to an event with a small evening bag.The other problem Is there is not an option for an SD card and from experience with Samsung as time goes on somehow no matter what you delete you just don't get space back and you need that with this phone especially if you want to take alot of pictures so you can use the SD card for pics.I think its ridiculous that it also doesn't give you the option to use wired earbuds as Bluetooth is not always an option or the charged device needs charging at least with wired you don't need to worry about that.I had the S10 the past 5 years and it was much more practical and also took great pictures.,12,8,Cellphones,4.7,,1,0.0744

Now unraveled to the point where other mats would have the backing show, I now see holes.I spent almost twice as much for this pet mat because of the color and the paw prints in the corners.

2023-06-25,True,2,"I have two corgis now and they were going through water fast. Felt like I was always refilling the bowl. I found this and for a couple weeks I thought it was great. Don’t get me wrong I could have cleaned it more often than I did but my regular bowls never looked like this one does. Yes the bowls can get slimy from them drinking which I understand but not inside the bottle! For a little bit, I thought the yellowish color towards the top of the bottle was from the sunlight. Was not!I feel so bad for my dogs and cat. No wonder they always preferred the regular bowl in the bedroom! What’s the point of having a huge bottle to refill less if it’s just going to be gross by the time they finish the bottle!? So what’s the filter for? To filter out the mold? Moving back to regular water bowls now. Not worth risking my pets health more than I already have!!! I’ll just have to buy the biggest size ceramic bowl I got from Petsmart.

The filter itself is tiny and sits in this plastic ring pictured where the water flows around and out the spout but the plastic ring is not able to be taken apart + cleaned and the whole thing is meant to be replaced every 30-45 days.30-45 days is enough time for bacteria and gunk to accumulate in that thing. Also, what a huge waste of plastic, why not make the plastic ring able to disassemble for cleaning and sell the actual filters?I don’t trust my pet to drink out of something I can’t clean thoroughly so I am returning this",56,31,Pet Supplies,4.5,,4,0.0004

This water bowl is sleek looking, efficient, EASY TO CLEAN and more importantly, keeps their water cool for long periods of time.Assembly is minimal and simple. It also came with a nice rubber cleaning brush which makes it very easy to clean the jug portion.

2023-05-19,True,5,"I got this for inside the house because our Husky pup is the thirstiest dog ever and because she likes to flip water dishes. Not only has it saved me from mopping, it's also saved me the hassle of refilling the bowl several times a day. Now I only have to refill the bottle two or three times a week. There hasn't been any attempt to splash around in the bowl portion or flip it over either.It's easy to remove the bottle to wash the bowl out without any water dribbling out too which is helpful since three dogs using it means the bowl needs washing daily.At the start,  I did have to dump the water out and rewash the bottle to get her and my other dogs to use it though so keep that in mind.

At first it seemed a little large for 2 cats,  but with the easy removal of the no spill bottle and removable stainless bowl the extra capacity of the water bottle allows us to wash the bowl without having to refill the bottle.

It was shipped with no additional packaging, so I was pleased it wasn’t cracked as the box was a bit crunched. Came with a bottle cleaner which is a nice touch. I bought this to replace the large Petmate Replendish plastic water dispenser/bowl combo I’ve had for years for my two 90 lb dogs; this is about 1/2 the size. I liked the stainless steel bowl in this one which is why I didn’t go for a straight replacement of the same item- the Petmate bowl was a pain to take apart to clean and one really needed to be thorough due to all of the bits and parts that went together.",247,52,Pet Supplies,4.5,,10,0.0002

2023-06-02,True,4,"Initially, I purchased a water dispenser ay a big chain store. The product flooded my floor constantly. Frustrasted, I gambled on spending the extra money to purchase 2 of these. The gamble paid off. They do not leak and are very quiet.  The stainless water bowl is a separate piece from the white bowl it sits in. This makes the products easy to clean. My only disappointment is that the bowl only dispenses about an inch of water. My older dog does not get around easily anymore. When she decides to get a drink, she likes to sit in front of the bowl and drink quite a bit.  Unfortunately, she laps up all the water in the bowl faster than it can dispense.

He drinks about two of these per day because of the medication he needs to be on for a lifelong condition. The only problem I have with it, is the metal part fits into the plastic part and water collects in between these two pieces and causes major overflow so I have to put a towel underneath it. The metal piece holds the flow valve nicely so I can’t see using it without the metal insert but thinking maybe I should try it. This product has really saved me from filling up my dogs water dish several times per day though. I’d rate it higher if it didn’t overflow so often though.

I worry that the little contraption that the top of the water bottle sits in will get moldy and be difficult to clean. The water container fills easily and I like that it doesn't drop when turned over, until seated in the contraption. However, the bottle seems to scare one of my dogs. It's not the noise it makes when filling the bowl, but seems to be the reflections of light because of the shape of the bottle. He literally won't go near it, which means he won't drink from it.

The water basin itself is very shallow and she gulps once and it has to refill the dish but the gurgling bubble noise is so loud that she jumps back.  Left it out all day and she would take 2 gulps and run from the bowl.  I chose to return it so my dog is no longer traumatized by it. She is suppose to be a watchdog as she is #130 and is Great Pyrenees/Saint Bernard, but now that I know that a water dish scares her, my next purchase should probably be a gun.",114,38,Pet Supplies,4.5,,2,0.0039
2023-03-08,True,4,"I purchased this mainly to throw the bowl in the dishwasher regularly; I'm not a fan of plastic.  Overall this is a well-designed product. I've been using it for a week now with no issues for my dog and two cats.  The only concern I have is the filter; I was there as a way to leave the filtering mechanism out.  I don't see the need to filter tap water and don't have any interest in replacing the filters.  I'll open the filter and remove the media so it doesn't get gross over time.  A watering bowl should be fine without an ongoing expense...who needs another subscription for something that is not required.UPDATE:  After using this for a few months, I found the filters get gross super fast.  After two or three weeks of use, I could see algae and mold growing inside the mouth of the filter.  I clean the bowl daily when I fill it, but food and floaties still get up against the plastic filter, which causes an issue.  I ended up 3d printing a replacement for the filter portion.  It does the same thing but has a small hole on the front to allow water to fill the bowl.  I printed it using food-safe plastic to toss it in the dishwasher when it needed to be sanitized.",247,52,Pet Supplies,4.5,,21,0.9456

It looks real nice, and clean! My dog is about 50 pounds and the bowl itself is a great size for him. I'll probably get a stand to put it on so it's a bit higher but this bowl was definitely worth it!*edit*It wasn't even a month before my dog chewed up the filter like there was no tomorrow. They do not sell the filter by itself, and this DOES NOT work without the filter! It's not a replaceable one like the cat fountains, it's a plastic piece at the bottom that presses the button to allow water to come out. That has a filter inside.This product is completely worthless to me now.*2nd edit*They finally sell a replacement filter for 50% of the price of a new dispenser.

2023-07-25,True,5,This came in so fast just in time for me to go on a trip. It’s a lot quieter than a regular hair blow dryer that I was using (a white Revlon one) I felt so bad cause the sound would startle her and she’d go crazy and try to escape. This does have attachments but I mainly use the brush head it cuts down on a lot of time so I don’t have to dry and brush separately. She was scared at first but after a few curious sniffs she warmed up to it! It’s a lot bigger than I expected too but not too big where if you need to pack for a trip it takes up too much room. I’d say the price point is typical compared to similar items & I like the colors especially the diamond indent type design.

2023-07-18,False,5,"We have a beautiful 2 year old Springer Spaniel who needs grooming at least weekly. To save money, I do some of this at home, and have even purchased a bag of bandanas and bows, for special occasions.Specifically, we have the outstanding ""Neakasa by neabot P1 Pro Pet Grooming Kit & Vacuum Suction"" system for combing, ""dethatching"" and cleaning up our little girl, but this time of year, while it's warm outside, I like to bathe her a couple times each month. Before we obtained the iFurffy dryer, I mostly let her air dry, as my wife wouldn't let me use her blow dryer (understandable), but I'm pretty sure having that LOUD noise right next to her would spook her pretty bad.Air drying often ends up with a tangled mess that I have to work hard to comb them out.So, enter the iFurffy. This dryer is compact, easy to hold, and quiet when in use, all things that make it MUCH better than a plain old ""hooman"" blow dryer. In addition, there are a number of handy accessories and nozzles. There are the standard styling and fluffing nozzles, a wide comb nozzle, and a ""negative ions fast drying handheld"" attachment. I have no idea how or if ""negative ions"" are being generated, but this accessory works similarly to a slicker brush, and really does dry quickly.The small size, and quiet operation, doesn't bother our girl at all, and like many dogs, she really doesn't like whirring things like vacuum cleaners and hair dryers.This is a very welcome addition to keeping our little girl beautiful, shiny and smelling great, all without having to take her anywhere.Highly recommended!",91,63,Pet Supplies,4.5,,1,0.0004
2023-04-17,False,5,"I am a groomer and this blower comes in as better than using a hair dryer on your dog. The hot settings is less than of your human hair dryer but can get hot as well(read more). Safety is my number one concern with grooming. Using too much heat for an animal or forcing air into an opening like ears, snout and anus is a big NO NO. Use caution and common sense when grooming at home. Also take in mind that dogs skin is healthy when it is oily not dry. Ever wonder why omega 3's are good for their coat? Do your research.Pros-I like it is not advertised as a forced dryer but a hair dryer!-I love the brush!!!!!! My Beiwer gets matted so easily and she is a squirmier when drying this turns a 2 handed job into a one handed job.-Attachments are nice and enough. Not too many as some models-It is ergonomically great for dogs so you can get their underbelly.-It has enough force to dry thick fur but not enough blow water off like a forced air dryer. Forced air dryers blow really hard and water shoots off the coat.-It is quieter but the motor is right beside the nozzle so it kind of defeats the purpose of having a quiet dryer. learn how to acclimate your pet to this. Youtube is your friend.-The Concentrator nozzle makes a high pitched sound so it may bother your dog. Use on low setting if needed-It is very compact so transport and storage is nice-Has a ground fault circuit interrupter to prevent shock-It looks very nice and stylish-It is pretty solid for a consumer product.Cons-On the hottest setting can get too hot. You will dry your dogs skin out fast and that is not good. Never use this setting for a long period. It can dry the oil and will make them itch. Bathing too much can do this as well.-Not for dogs who are afraid of motors, vacuums etc. You are right in their face with this. It will traumatize the dog. Learn to acclimate you pet to sounds don't just start drying.I would recommend this for medium coats like short haired terriers or lab like coats or even cats if you can get the cat to sit through it. I would not recommend this for long hair poodles(or doodles) or husky coats. It will not blow water from a thick coat and will take too much time to dry those types of thick coats and could potentially dry the skin out. With Thick coats I would always recommend a forced air dryer.",91,63,Pet Supplies,4.5,,1,0.0001
2023-04-22,False,5,"Let me first say that this dryer is impressive from the second you open it. It just presents as quality at every turn. I love receiving products like this. This type of quality is not common these days. It feels solid. The parts are all polished and tightly assembled. I really like the almost 8-foot cord and it actually comes with a real Velcro cable strap, not a cheap twisty-tie like you might usually get. It is in a box that it can very easily be repacked into for storage. This is a huge plus for me.Now, functionally, I tried to just play with the buttons without reading any instructions and I found myself pressing buttons that I didn’t want to press so I’m thinking there might be some practice involved. I want to be sure I’m not turning up the heat too high. There are some little white and red level lights to indicate Low-Med-High heat and cool so I’m not too worried about it. I’m not ready to use it on the dogs yet and this was all part of the initial acclimation exercise. My biggest concern was the volume, however, my wife insists that it’s not as loud as her blow dryer and I read professional groomers saying that it is actually relatively quiet. The product page has an image stating that it emits 40-75 dB. I have a free decibel meter phone app, which is likely not the most accurate but it measured 90-100 dB. I guess the main test is how the dogs feel about it and, well, the Rottweiler didn’t try to attack and eat it. In fact, he was sniffing and licking it right out of the box. I turned it on in his presence and his demeanor did not change which is good. He normally attacks the vacuum cleaner. I did not use it on him obviously and likely won’t for several acclimation sessions. Our Belgian Mal turned away immediately but she hates anything to do with a bath anyway. She won’t fight it though if we push the issue. The Rotty is another story. I will update after future bath sessions. So far, however, I am impressed.",91,63,Pet Supplies,4.5,,0,0.0

We were not watching all the pieces and when you have three dogs one dog snuck in and stole a piece and did you some of it. It's still functional but one of the sockets that blows air now comes out a little differently.I would recommend this just maybe not as efficiently as they say with blowing and getting it done faster. Also, I did not find that it heats up as fast even on the highest setting that it would burn my dog. Never once was I worried about her overheating and I'm very good at making sure that does not happen as I am trained as a groomer and I do know the signs of heat exhaustion.

It does take a little longer than usual for the temp to switch/adapt.Another down side is that there's nothing to store it in, nor the accessories, except the box itself.

I had decided not to read more of the series but I wanted to know if they had put the body where I thought.  So, I skipped book two and bought this one because it was only .99.  The characters in this book were okay and, as always Ms. Brown's details about the period that she is writing about are fascinating.  The story itself was slow and boring and I started skimming to get to the end.  I should have just turned to the epilogue.  And, yes, the body is where I thought they had put it.

2021-11-17,False,4,"“A Web of Secrets”, by Robert KaganJews, The Third Reich and A Web of Secrets book #3“A Web of Secrets” brings to a close a heart wrenching and moving historical WW2 fiction trilogy. The stories in each installment revolve around two sisters: Kara and Anka and in each episode we discover more details how the war affected their lives. It is always preferable to read books in sequence and I strongly suggest you do this.In the 3rd story we go back in time when Oskar was a young boy growing up in Germany being indoctrinated into a system he was forced to be part of. Then we move to the war and Oskar takes center stage while Kara, his loving wife, is still ignorant that her beloved Oskar is the sadistic commandant in Auschwitz and to everyone who he takes a dislike to. More killing and more surprises awaits us in this terrible family saga.Will she see the true him? What about Abram the father of her son will he survive the horror of the camp? How about Anka where will her life lead? All this is answered through the vivid lines Ms. Kagan expertly penned for our enjoyment in the final book. It is a page-tuner, no doubts.Once I opened this book I didn’t want to put it down although at midway I asked myself seems I read this before why rehashing the past stories, then it came clear that the repetitions were warranted in order for those who haven’t read the previous books get up to speed, although I find this to be a bit of an irritant. That aside, the story is action packed, emotional and filled with naïve love. I like the characters even the evil Oskar , all were well- drawn so much so that I wanted many times to slap Kara for her to acknowledge how manipulative her killer of a husband was. But eventually Oskar secrets caught up to him and his careful crafted life crumbled around him.....and awe what an ending....I hate to see this series end but it was a good journey reading it. Thank you, Ms. Kagan for providing hours of enjoyment to your reader.I received this book from The Book Whisperer via Netgalley for my thoughts.",592,11,Kindle Books - Romance,4.5,4.5,0,0.0

I then put it in the trunk of my car, and it's worked great for a few months. It suddenly just stopped sending information and does not track anything at all. The cost of the device plus the $20/month for service is supposed to get you a lifetime guaranteed replacement of the device. Good luck getting Optimus to honor that. I've been trying for almost 2 weeks. You can't even get customer service. You're lucky to get an email, and they will just ask if it lights up and if you turned it off and back on and if it's outside or inside. They act like I'm lying. They can see that it hasn't recorded anything in over a month. Do they think I haven't driven my car in all that time?! Spent $220 overall, and it's just a worthless brick now.

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND looking into an OBD port version since those are usually much cheaper a month (don’t ask me why cause I wish I knew) but I can do updates every 10s for less than $9 a month with the OBD port version (at least from Land Air Sea). However, they can be very noticeable in many cars. So if discretion is what you seek then this is what you want since the price is good for what you get and the same (or less) as any other brand (w/ OBD) and is a reliable company. So choice is easy. If you can use OBD then go for another brand. If not, then is one of the best for the price right now.Cheers.",47,5,Electronics Misc,4.4,,8,0.0002

Dislike the fact that you need to pay for one month of service ($19.99) before it will even activate. Also dislike that it costs $19.99/month to use on top of the cost of buying the thing.

2023-02-18,True,2,"The tablet is just fine. But the setup procedure is so frustrating that I almost sent it back. The problem is that after you go through the setup steps that you encounter when you first turn the device on--and the device tells you that you are all set--they download update after update in the background. If you try to download the app for which you bought the tablet--say, Kindle--the device just appears to hang. The same if you try to download a book to your Kindle. If you pull down the notifications panel you get a hint about what's going on, but nothing to suggest that the process is going to bring your device to its knees. It is this sneaky kind of bandwidth theft that I waists my time trying to figure out that really frustrates me. If they had just said, ""Look, we have to download a bunch of updates. It will take about an hour. So just set the device aside and do something else until we finish,"" I would have been perfectly satisfied. It is the way they mislead you that is unacceptable. It's also unnecessary. Stupid!Now, having struggled with this tablet for six months, I think I'm going to junk it. I use it mostly to read Kindle books and magazines. I turn it off when I'm not reading so I won't have to charge it so often, in the hope that I can extend the battery's life. Samsung updates their interface software quite frequently, so when I turn the tablet on, I frequently have to wait as much as five minutes before I can use it. Even when I can get an app like Kindle to open, it abruptly shuts down. I'm reasonably sure this is because processor cycles are being used to continue the the latest update, even thought the developers want you to think all is ready to go. This kind of thing wasn't a problem with earlier tablets, but Samsung has apparently decided to add a lot of glitz to their interface at the expense of functionality. Too much glitz for what this relatively inexpensive tablet can handle.

2022-12-18,True,2,"Update:  As of the OS update that dropped on 1/31/23, you can now move big apps that you don’t want to take up all of your internal storage to the SD card.  As I say below, this is absolutely vital for the 32GB version of this tablet.  This doesn’t change the fact that it’s generally a slower tablet than some of its similarly priced competitors, but the 32GB version of the tablet is no longer a hundred dollar paperweight if you need more than two or three apps.  I’d up the star rating a bit if the tablet wasn’t more expensive now than it was over the holidays.Original review below:This would be.a decent (if slow) entry level Android tablet but for the fact that Samsung’s update to Android 12 broke the ability to move apps to the SD card.  Since a lot of the 32GB is used up by the preinstalled software, this means you have very little room for adding apps.  You can still store media (movies, music, etc,) on the SD card, but you will still run out of space for apps almost immediately after getting the tablet.Avoid buying this tablet in the 32GB version until Samsung fixes this bug - if they ever do.The screen quality is not very good.  I’m not talking about the resolution (It’s low, but you can look at the resolution in the product description so it’s not a surprise), but I’ve noticed uneven backlighting near the screen edges (which can be annoying watching movies or using dark mode in dark environments) on several samples of this Samsung tablet.  I haven’t seen these issues on competitor tablets even at the same price point, so this appears to be a Samsung thing.Sound quality from the two built-in speakers isn’t very good either - even with the supposed Dolby Atmos features enabled - but is okay for basic media watching.The tablet is pretty sluggish - probably partly from limited RAM (3 GB in the 32GB storage version) and partly a sluggish processor.  Don’t expect to be running newer games at full speed on this tablet, though older and less demanding games should be okay.Even the non-cellular versions of this tablet have a GPS which works pretty well, so you can use this tablet for offline mapping with various offline maps apps from the play store.

Even swiping between different screens was glitchy and not smooth at all. It was an eye sore to be honest with you.  Opening apps gave me the feeling of sitting in traffic. IT JUST TOOK FOREVER!. Also the touch screen I would have to tap 2 or 3 times before it would even register my tap.This is al because the processor in this tablet (MediaTek Helio P22) IS TRASH and extremely slow.  I returned this tablet after 3 days and just bought a Galaxy Tab S7 fe... I researched the different processors and the one in the S7 fe is 5 times as faster.It sad bcuz I really wanted a smaller tablet but it was not worth the ""sitting and traffic"" feeling it gave me.

No telling what other differences there are between the apps that are able to run on the A7 Lite and 'real' versions. Very disappointing.

I Literally sit and watch pages and images on websites load. Same is true for  apps.

I know it can be a little scary to give them a tablet with access to the entire Internet. However, the samsung is a good size tablet for her. The family link app is great and setting up all the parental controls on the tablet was easy. I speak with her about being safe on the Internet and I was able to set up the tablet to do things like request my approval before she can download things. Overall, I think it's a great tablet for a kid and would be great for an adult as well for basic use.Update: soon after purchasing this tablet we noticed the camera kept crashing. I would restart it and try other ways to fix but the app still crashes and the camera has pretty much not worked since we bought it.

I use Square for my business and this was supposed to make my life easier and safer because I wouldn't keep handing strangers my phone and I could keep my personal files/accounts and work files/accounts separate and on different devices. Unfortunately, this thing is so slow that I feel it's costing me money. It takes 5+ minutes to check out my clients when my phone took about 45 seconds. That's time I need to clear & disinfect my station before my next client. That's a whole military fade. That's a crying break in the bathroom after a 6+ hour color correction.

But only 2 months out and it's already extremely laggy, terrible battery life (only about 2 hours of use from full), and painstakingly slow. In hindsight, I'd have been better off just shelling out the extra money for a decent tablet, considering how bad it is within only a couple months I'm sure it's not going to be usable for much longer, so I didn't actually save myself money by going with this ""affordable alternative"". Even fresh out of the box, it was noticeably slower than my 8 year old, has been dropped and struggles if I have more than a few tabs open laptop.

The other two were knocked off because it won't activate on Verizon's service or a pay as you go service. That ain't good!I wanted a LTE tablet in my vehicle to run Maps and do the random Google search when required so I bought this as it wasn't too expensive and has a bigger screen than my phone. During setup when it came to activating the LTE service a message popped up saying that it couldn't be done and I traded out the SIM for bring your own tablet, pay as you go, one and it popped up a message saying it couldn't be activated on their service.... no bueno.I read other reviews that had the same information but figured I'd try my luck as I've been fairly successful in getting things to function when other couldn't. Trust the reviews, they ain't lying. The tablet itself is good and functions like it's supposed to but there are cheaper versions for a straight WIFI tablet than paying for a LTE one and then not being able to use it. I just said the heck with it and went to a Verizon store and bought the same tablet from them already activated. The model numbers between the two tablets are the same so that wasn't the issue. I didn't bother trying to call Verizon to get this tablet running on LTE, it just wasn't worth my time and I didn't have it to waste anyway.I did keep this tablet and use it for a E-Reader for work instead of my more expensive Tab S7 FE and it's a good little tablet... no complaints with that.

2021-11-29,True,3,"I'm a huge Samsung fan, but this product was a huge disappointment. I was looking to upgrade my Samsung Tab S2, which has a 4:3 ratio screen and a sharp AMOLED display, with the A7.  Here are the issues:1. Screen. The screen is a dull, lifeless, non-sharp TFT display like you used to find in laptops.  The screen looks nothing like what you see on the website or on phones such as the S21.  The 16:9 ratio screen only provides for a 6x5 icon layout, which is not even as good as the Tab S2.  That means a lot of wasted space.  I also fail to see the value of the long narrow screen for anything but movies.  It is not good as a book reader.2.  Weight. The tablet feels bulky and heavy.3. No Samsung email app.  For some reason, the Samsung email app is not only not included, but is also not compatible with this device (and notwithstanding that it has been on prior tablets like the Tab S2 and on phones such as the S9 and S21).  This by itself made the device unaccpeable.  The Samsung email app easily interfaced with Exchange servers and other email providers such as Verizon.  Syncing Exchange contact and calendar folders via the Samsung email app meant that the native Android Contacts and Calenadar apps would be immediately populated with data.  No replacement email app will do that.I don't know the target audience for this product, but it is certainly not anyone looking for a high-performance small tablet with a great screen.",752,149,Laptops and Tablets,4.5,,7,0.0022

However, on the Samsung tablet they do not work correctly all the time, and in fact force the user into additional purchases unless he pays money or ""lose all the work done so far""-One nice thing about the Samsung tablet is at least the case I had fit and functioned properly.

2023-04-23,True,5,"I had bought the exact same tablet but I made the huge mistake of buying an international model which as it turns out is not under warranty in the United States so Samsung stiffed me out my paying$155 for my previous identical (but international version) tablet by not fixing my tablet even though Samsung is the one who broke my tablet with an operating system update that bricked it! I did not break my tablet but some idiot Samsung coder sent a system update to my tablet that rendered it a paperweight because it never booted up again after that. Samsung USA refuses to honor any Samsung international products warranty, don't even try asking them!! I tried my butt off for one month straight talking to so many different Samsung people and even had a local repair shop send it off to Texas only for the repair center to tell me they're not going to fix it so they sent it back to me still broken. They expect me to contact and send that one off to Samsung in Chile, South America and maybe they'll fix it but I haven't done it yet. I just bought another tablet but made damn sure that it was the USA warranty one so that if Samsung messes up my tablet again then they will honor the warranty this time. I bought this tablet to use for flying my DJI Air 2S drone and it works perfectly for that. I'll be surprised if Amazon lets this review get through but if it does, great, this is your warning to never ever ever buy an international product because if it ever breaks for whatever reason, Samsung's fault or not, and it's still under warranty, Samsung will not honor the warranty in the USA. I liked this tablet so much that I bought another one because it's the perfect size for me and works just fine.EDIT 7-14-23: it's near 3 months later and to add to my nightmare with trying to get Samsung in Chile South America to fix my under warranty tablet, those clowns not only stabbed me in the back by telling me that I would have had to have bought it in their region  (around Chile) in order for them to honor the warranty on it which is impossible when it was bought from Amazon. I have never in my life been so disappointed in Samsung because it was Samsung's fault to begin with that my tablet suddenly wouldn't boot up anymore because of an OS update that turned it into one $155 paperweight!! I regret buying the second tablet to replace the first one that Samsung screwed up on me because I really should have said goodbye forever to Samsung for the god-awful way that I was disrespected and mistreated by every single Samsung employee throughout my journey to try to have my tablet repaired. I wasted hundreds of hours over at least 6 months trying my damnedest to get someone, anyone, anywhere, to care enough to realize that Samsung stabbed me in the back when they refused to fix something they broke!!! Samsung is a very unethical company and only cares about the numbers. I'm just one little number out of hundreds of millions of numbers who still buy the products so my little drop in the bucket loss of income for them doesn't mean squat in reality. But I hope that I convinced a lot of people to not buy Samsung now knowing what they have done to me which they could very well do to you. I wasn't kidding about staying away from international version Samsung products. Do not even think about buying them because Samsung will send a system update to it then poof!, Your once perfectly working tablet has just become a dead in the water tablet that Samsung won't do a damn thing about. Do not trust Samsung to do the right thing like I thought Samsung was going to do here in this case. I kept getting sad excuses over and over and over about how there was nothing they could do and all kinds of blah blah because it's not covered in the USA. Then there's the communication barrier where I couldn't even speak to anyone of the Samsung reps from Chile since I don't speak Spanish at all nor do I know anybody that does. Nobody there knew how to speak English. Every time I email them in English, if I actually got a response, it was always a lame pathetic excuse that they can't help me out because of some excuse or another. I was at the point where I was willing to pay the international shipping to send it from the state of Delaware in the USA to down there then paid to ship it back but they didn't care to hear that. Those morons just kept giving me one hard time after another. And then finally the one year warranty ran out on me so I knew at that point that there was no way in hell that I was going to be able to get anyone to listen to me so I gave up trying. Samsung can kiss my butt because Samsung cost me so many hundreds of lost wasted hours of my life because of one of their defective products. Nobody wanted to accept responsibility for some coder screwing up the code that bricked my tablet! All it would have taken would have been a simple replacement but as big a company as Samsung is, they couldn't even do that much for me even though I had more than enough proof as to what Samsung did to me. Samsung is a very sad company it doesn't care about the end users and only cares about the numbers. They are winning the numbers game for sure. They might even be too big to fail. After I realized it was useless to try to get Justice anymore, I went and bought myself an iPad and now I used it for my drone flights and it works beautifully. I don't have to worry about being told a bunch of BS from Apple support because everybody knows that Apple support is a very ethical company that doesn't play games like Samsung does. So I would suggest to everyone reading this that you reconsider buying Samsung and buy Apple products instead. You'll get much better quality and much better service and no backstabbing like Samsung does. I'm living proof that they do that.",11975,894,Laptops and Tablets,4.5,,57,0.11043333333333333

While the 3 is ok the 32 g is to small . I added 128 to Sim slot , you need this on android. Andriod does not seam to manage this autocratically.

The audio is great, with good stereo channel separation due to its large size. I like the compact design too. However, I experienced some unexpected shortcomings:- The Android OS version installed appears to be limited in some ways- Using SD Card storage doesn't seem to be supported in app settings, as it is in other Android devices. Some apps allow you to configure the storage location in settings, and this is the only way to do it- Bluetooth connectivity seems a bit jenky. Simply turning on your bluetooth device doesn't connect it right away. You usually have to go into settings to do it.- Wifi connectivity is a bit jenky too.Generally a good device. I wouldn't advice using it for anything extremely important, but at this price it seems like an easy buy.",2282,247,Laptops and Tablets,4.5,,2,0.0026

The battery is big and last a long while.Only reason I took one star away is the color balance. I knew the resolution was 1340 X 800. I was concerned with seeing the pixels. I am used to the sharp Nexus 7 Gen 2 that had 1900 X 1200 on a 7"" screen. but the Tab A7 Lite looks just fine. You have to look very close to see the pixels.  What got me returning it is the color. It is heavily into the blue range. I put it side-by-side with all my other Android tablets, phones and a iPad mini and the blue just looks wrong.  I tried the build in color correction and it only got it even less natural. Tried some third party color adjustment apps.

For example, it does not have a time in its wedge, only a clock app, my old Lenovo has a big time, whenever you look at its screen, you can see the time. Also its alarm to wake you up is very strange, for some reason, a couple days when I really needed the alarm it did not set off. I cleaned the cache today and hope it will work better. Also the alarm is not easy to manage, such as, it has very small line to let you snooze for another 5 minutes, my old Lenovo has a big zzz icon you can touch it and continue snoozing.

I was able to transfer my apps seamlessly through Samsung Smart Switch and, best of all, when I turn on the Tab A7 8.7 Lite I can IMMEDIATELY get out to the internet and my apps.

It's not complicated but she is so it did not work out so well for her so now it's mine. I got it on sale for $120 and it's well worth it. It is slightly slow but it is also Android 11 (Can update to 13) and you could put an SD card in it. It does have a headset Jack which is good also. I consider it a low end  tablet but due to the fact that it is the Samsung brand makes me feel it's stable. If you just want to watch videos and do a few things it's perfect. I have not tested it for games because that's not who I am but for streaming video you get hours and hours if you set the brightness to about 25%. I had no issue with the Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. I'm not sure if it's worth $160 which I believe is the regular price but it is a name brand so I would recommend it to anyone who just needs a basic tablet and you won't be disappointed.,11975,894,Laptops and Tablets,4.5,,3,0.0024

2023-03-23,True,1,"I purchased two of these tablets a year ago and both ""failed to turn on"" literally one week after they were out of warranty. It seems as if it was almost designed to happen. Do to the crunch of needing these tablets for my day to day dealings I purchased a new one while I figured out what to do next with the two that failed. This newest one I purchased ""failed to turn on"" in UNDER A MONTH of receiving it!So, I sent all three in for service two weeks ago through Samsung. I was told that each one had to have the PBA-Main replaced, which is a power board/mother board according to the Samsung rep. Not only that but each one had physical damage. ""Dented corners and scratches"" which also led to their failures.I assure you, all of these units were pristine in condition. They were housed in protective cases and had screen protectors on each. The only activity they saw would be comparable to light office work. No adverse environments nor conditions. The kicker is the packaging I sent them in for repair was light years better then what I received them back in.https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09NXW6K6V/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0922DRRBT/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1So longer story longer the newest tablet is under warranty and was repaired without charge but the rub to that is now the tablet has gone form a 1yr warranty to only a 30 day warranty since it has been serviced.The original two will cost $100 each to repair and will receive a 30 day warranty for only the repairs that are made.Moral of the story...the tablets accomplished what I needed to them to do for the time that they were operational. I'm disappointed that they failed and soon as they did and that the cost to repair them is only $20 dollars less than the purchase price of a brand new one that includes a warranty.Will I be buying a new replacement?

2022-09-19,True,1,"After working with at least three Samsung ""technical agents"", I was told that the SD card is a ""known issue"" and there was nothing that could be done about it at this time. I evaluated the use of this product without the use of the SD card and decided that it was useless.  Since the best they could do was offer me a higher priced product that would do what this was supposed to do, I decided that getting rid of it was my best option.  Frankly, the limitations created by not being able to use the SD card make this product pretty worthless, and the Amazon Kindle will work much better for much less money. So, I dumped this tab on the last day.  I will be looking at either the iPad Mini if I can get by with my one drive or the Surface pro from Microsoft if I need the SD. I would stay with Kindle, but the software limitations are super irritating and ridiculous.  Samsung really let me down on this one.This product was working well for me, and I was in the store by programs onto my SD card. Then android came along with an update and suddenly nothing worked. All of the programs that I put on my SD card became nonfunctional and I had to reinstall them. Further, I was no longer able to store any programs or memory from programs onto the SD card. That means, the SD card is useless to me. I contacted Samsung and talked to them and they have confirmed there is no update for this and the only thing I can do is take my tablet in and have the old software put back on it. That solves nothing as any time there’s an upgrade I don’t get the benefit of the upgrade and if I do I lose the ability of the SD card. So why provide a tablet with an SD card up to a terabyte if I can’t use it?

Walmart's ONN tablet was twice as fast as Samsung and out performed it as well. The battery life is horrible. Same about of time doing same task, Lenovo was at 98% where Samsung was at 88%.

Specifically I use Wear OS and InfoWear to connect my smart watches. I use this software to monitor heart rate while exercising, steps walked, etc. and it is required to tap into that functionality. While I think Wear OS is garbage (lack of functionality), it great to install watch faces but that is as far as it goes. Fossil watches require Wear OS, so probably don't buy a fossil watch. When I bought my Fossil Gen 3 watch this was okay but these days smart watches provide more functionality and Google just has not kept up. InfoWear seams really good as it tracks everything I need it to. Watch face select is terrible, but third party apps like Facer fix that. Nope this device is not compatible. Apparently it is not compatible with Samsung's Smart Watch app either. So far I have tried five apps and none of them function. Either they install and won't run, or the Google store says they are not compatible. What use is a device that is not compatible with any apps? Complete waste of money.

He then looked  up my item and saw that it was out and “would not sell me the display model,” as he sternly told me right after. He tried to sell me a different tablet (because he thinks he gets commission off up selling) and I told him that this tablet was the newest model (the other Samsung tablet came out in 2017) and I prefer that one. Ignoring what I said, he then explained to me “Next time you buy an electronic, you need to ask someone if they have it first.” Since there is no employee that works in electronics at this place, was I to bother a cashier or the lady who folds clothes? Or did I need to ask King Green Vest if I can partake of a tablet. I ordered my tablet from Amazon since when they tell you it is in stock, you do not need “make sure it is in stock.”That being said, the table is amazing. Display is nice, 1080p looks good on this small size. Battery lasts awhile, as most Samsung tablets do. The sensitivity may be not to my liking, but it could be due to the screen protector.

You have to understand that I am a foster parent, and one of the things we do right away is get the new kiddos a small, simple tablet to help with anxiety.  We previously bought the Amazon fire tablets, but for the small price increase, you get a much much much better tablet with the Samsung.  The screens are bullet proof, battery is rock solid, runs an android os which means there is a wide variety of apps and controls available.  Our oldest one is going on 2 years and it gets used, and I mean used heavily.  The battery is still lasting more than 8 hours, the touch screen is worn in the heavy use areas but still working fine.  The cases are widely available and cheap.  I think the cases I buy for them are $10.00.  If you need one right away, the Amazon renewed service is great.  Those tablets are easily as good as the brand new ones and we haven't had any issues.  I purchased these brand new on a black friday deal for $98.00.  At that price, we stock up and get several.  We also run Google Family link and that control app is seamless between these tablets and my iPhone 13.  You just have to open a google email for the kids.

Be sure to purchase a protective case. The soft cases with handles works best for kids.

They come automatically with 32g of storage, which is great when downloading a bunch of games and apps that hog storage. Add an SD card and you're golden for a while. In particular was a messaging app that allows us to video chat as a family of 4 - the tablets do not have a lag even with 4 on video at the same time and show a clear picture using the front facing camera. And the battery lasts for what seems like forever - the first day with a full charge, it was used for over 4 hours (per the parental app we also downloaded) with videos and games, and still had over half of the charge. And as far as the size, you wouldn't think going from a 7"" screen to an 8"" screen would really make a difference, but it really does. The colors are vivid and bright. I can't speak for the tech stuff, but as a daily tablet to run games and videos and surf the internet and video chat, this really is great.

I would say about a ½ to ¾ of a second. Battery seems decent. Haven't really been able to dive into it as far as charging time and battery length. But it does hold a charge something serious though.

2023-06-16,True,5,"I have purchased at least four charging stations from different companies over the last couple of years. I use them when traveling in addition to placing them in various locations at home. After using each of them I wind up with a list of pros and cons. This is the first charging device that I can't find anything negative to report. Its apparent that the designers put real thought into building a better Charging Station, and I am very pleased with my experience so far. The ONLY little negative that I can think of to say, and this is knit-picking for sure, is that the power cord is shorter than I'd like. I have this device on my nightstand and plugged into the wall behind it. It's long enough, but its close. A longer power cord would be appreciated for sure. By the way, all of the others I own also have shorter power cords.Here are some of the highlights that I love:1. A built-in Apple Watch Charger!  No need to use the one that shipped with your watch. This was a welcome surprise, especially since I would have had to buy another one. Great addition, and the only charger I own with this feature.2. No annoying bright green, blue, red lights on this device. Because of this alone, this device immediately moved to my nightstand. I don't want or need LED lighting effects next to my bed in the middle of the night. One of the charging stations I have flashes wildly when the phone is done charging. WHY?? Because they could, but it shows a lack of common sense product development. Instead, this device has 3 subtle green LEDs on the base of the device. One to show the Phone is charging, one for the watch, and one for the airpods. Another very nice touch is that these lights automatically turn off after maybe 20 seconds. So, my nightstand is dark like I like it. Not to worry though, should you have a problem where your device stops charging for some reason, those LEDs will continuously flash to alert you. I have a very thick case on my phone and as such, if I don't place it on the charger correctly, it will flash at me. I correct it, and I'm good to go. Perfect! It's a subtle and very functional feature, especially for a device next to my bed.3. Sturdy, attractive, and well planned design. This device has a solid, quality feel to it, and I really like the attention to detail. For example, there's a subtle, but very appreciated design feature that I haven't seen on any of my other devices. They added rubber under where the phone and airpods charge instead of just the slippery plastic. So the phone sits on top of this rubber and doesn't slide around like my other chargers.To sum it up, I appreciate it when a design is well thought out, and this device corrects all the things that I didn't like about my other devices, and then surprised me with the addition of rubber that the phone and airpods sit on while charging, a great idea on a much improved Charging Station.",1930,815,Cellphones,4.5,,34,0.0

I had been looking for a charger like this after I switched to an iPhone SE from my Google Pixel. With that switch I also traded my Galaxy Watch 4 for an Apple Watch SE. I have another charger just like this for the Pixel and Galaxy watch in black, so this one in white was just the next logical step. It is by far my favorite charger type. I appreciate the magsafe ones, but there is always the chance it falls off in the night or something. I prefer these standup types of chargers versus the lay down ones because it's much easier to see your equipment and make sure it's charging. I especially like the glossy bit behind the phone as it seems to provide more grip on the phone. The JARGOU is nice in that it has LEDs to show me it's charging and they are separated by what device is charging. It's also nice that they are very muted in color and brightness and don't light up my entire room and keep me up at night. All in all, a nice wireless charger for my nightstand and a fair price (in my opinion), especially since it includes a QC 3.0 adapter and USB-C cable.",1930,815,Cellphones,4.5,,7,0.0124

However, the guiding questions are specific and have helped me get into the practice of journaling every day. I keep the journal on my nightstand and only need 5 minutes a day to complete the questions. While it may seem very little time, these 5 minutes of journaling have helped feel less stressed and have allowed me to calm my mind.

I guess part of the point is to get you out of your comfort zone but they just don’t make sense to me? And there is only 5 lines to express and write… Very disappointed. Not sure if I will be able to keep writing or have to purchase another work book. This one is just boring and not as helpful as I’d thought.

I thought I could do a section/week.These are interesting questions to make you stop and reflect in the moment. I really like and I use some of the prompts during skill building sessions with my own clients. What I don't like is that there is limited space to answer and it feels a little strange in that I'm writing to no one but myself.Improvements that I've noticed:I have horrible ADHD and I've started to notice that I'm more able to take a time and set it aside to writing or accomplishing something without my mind being distracted by random thoughts popping up in my head.

I came into this with some specific goals, and I feel like the journal is helping me work towards those goals in a doable but proactive way.Each week of the journal focuses on specific aspects of your life. It has a supportive overall tone, but it also focuses on specific approaches to not only being aware of our thoughts and approaches to life and problems but how to change these things for the better.There is a theme for each week, like ""Connection & Engagement"" and ""Calm & Resiliency.""

The idea is to write a brief, considered response and then sit with that for a little while.What I like about this journal is the prompts, which I find engaging and helpful, and the focus on concrete ideas, instead of vague platitudes.

2023-07-23,True,5,I got the Roku stick because I was having problems with DirecTVStream on a Samsung TV.  The Samsung app on the TV itself would not work properly for some DVR playback features and would occasionally buffer and freeze with other apps as well.  I checked the TV installed apps for updates and did remove / re-installs but the issues persisted which lead me to think maybe I needed a new TV.  After installing the Roku stick those problems were solved.  I've found the Roku system to be much better experience over the TV installed apps.  The phone app for the remote is also nice and allows use of headphones.  A great product and value for the money.,2399,176,Electronics Misc,4.5,,0,0.002

I will also preface by saying that I also had literally no issues with my internet; it never disconnected, I never had speed issues, and I had no complaints.Anyway, after around a year, the Roku began to interfere with my Wifi. Whenever I streamed a show/movie, every 5 minutes or so, the stream would buffer and reconnect after a minute. Interestingly, my phone, laptop, and other devices would all disconnect from the Wifi at this time. I observed that I would have no connectivity issues for days or weeks at a time, including when streaming from my computer, but the moment I streamed from the Roku is when my Wifi would disconnect/reconnect from all of my devices. It was truly odd and I could not find any troubleshooting tips online nor through customer service, so perhaps this is a unique situation to me unfortunately, but I ended up throwing away the Roku, bought an Apple TV, and probably will never switch back.",53,14,Electronics Misc,4.5,,0,0.0003

In actuality this streaming stock has built in glitches Roku technicians can't understand or fix.

Here lately power cycling doesn't work everytime. If I had to do it over again I would not have bought the Roku stick it gets very hot and is not reliable.

2022-10-05,True,4,"I bought this renewed because I wanted the 90 day return policy as my experience with Roku in the past hasn’t been the best. I’m very impressed by the quality of the refurbished device. My only complaint is the glossy power adapter was pretty scratched up but after plugging it in I’ll never see it again. Otherwise the remote and stick itself look brand new. It was easy to set up, as I’ve had a Roku before so all of my channels (apps) synced during set up and most already had my accounts signed in.The biggest downside to every Roku for me is the lack of Twitch support. I use Twitch almost every day so it’s a huge bummer there is not a native Twitch app. However the Streaming Stick 4K does support AirPlay, so an easy enough workaround is to just mirror Twitch from my iPhone or iPads. Annoying but not a dealbreaker.Also I’m happy to confirm that in addition to Dolby Vision this Streaming Stick 4K supports Dolby Atmos as well. I saw a ton of conflicting information online in my research of this device, with most sources and reviews claiming only the Roku Ultra supports Dolby Atmos. I can confirm that after testing almost every app I use, from Netflix to HBO Max and Disney+, that they all support Dolby Vision and Atmos. For $40 I’m really impressed. I prefer the Roku interface to Fire TV, and the Chromecast with Google TV is sluggish in comparison to this Roku. It’s no Apple TV 4K, but for the price you pay I think this Roku is one of the best options. Much better value than the Roku.And I stuck with the Roku Stick 4K over the 4K+ because I don’t want an always-listening remote, and since it’s 2022 I didn’t plan on plugging in crappy little wired headphones to the remote for private listening. Also I live alone with dogs so private listening is a useless feature for me in general. I’d say save the $30 up front and get this stick instead. You can always upgrade the remote later. If it wasn’t such a hassle to return it (basically I’m lazy) I would send this renewed device back and buy it new. After a couple days of testing I’m happy to say I plan on keeping this Streaming Stick 4K permanently, so I have a little buyer’s remorse for not just getting it new.

They have the order sizes by age which was helpful because different countries tend to run their S,M,L different than the US.  I ordered the 11-13yr size for my almost 13yr knowing that he is a little smaller than his peers.  I normally purchase US size 12/14 for him since he has long arms and there is room to grow.  This ""11-13"" sweatshirt is exactly that, as it does run smaller than a US 12/14.  The item itself was labeled as an XXL so I am grateful for the accurate ordering chart.

According to your size chart medium should be the smallest size. That means the labels on your packages don’t match the size chart or the selection options. I have submitted an exchange but I’m not optimistic that I’ll receive the medium I need.

2023-07-24,True,5,"I've been an Android enthusiast since the first Android phone was available here, the HTC Dream/Google G1, I've run custom firmware, and tweaked the bejesus out of my devices, so I think I know a thing or two.This phone is absolutely top-notch. High spec hardware that works great, in a beautiful, slickly designed package. The Oneplus 11 will hang with any of the current gen Samsungs or Pixel Pro in just about any way. The camera performance may not test quite as highly as a current Galaxy S Ultra or Pixel Pro, but the cameras are very good and very close! Beautiful screen, blazing fast performance, 16gb RAM, and all the 5G and LTE bands you need for any US carrier, so what's not to like?I've found the battery life to be very good, as I still have at least 50% left when I get home from work. And as for charging, WOW, this thing charges ridiculously fast with the included charger - faster than just about anything else out there, and most phones don't even come with a charger anymore. Igo from 40-50% to full in almost no time. I did turn off the Wise charging feature though because I couldn't figure out how to set it up, and its mystery schedule didn't jibe with my super early wake up time.The lack of wireless charging seems unthinkable for an otherwise incredible flagship-level phone in 2023, and I have no idea why they omitted it. This is unforgivable, although I will say that with the battery life and super fast charging I can get by without wireless. This need not be a deal breaker even if you must have it, since wireless adaptors are all over Amazon for like $12.I have found some negative aspects of this phone, albeit minor ones I can live with. For one, the phone is beautifully designed but very slippery in the hand. You're going to protect your investment with a case anyway though, aren't you? I found a nice clear TPU one that shows it off will protecting it a bit and adding enough grip to make me comfortable. And I do wish the screen was flat rather than curved. I see no benefit to the curved edges, which can cause glare at some angles and lighting conditions, and they make screen protectors and cases a little difficult to engineer perfectly.The fingerprint sensor is my only other gripe. It works, but I have yet to find an under-screen sensor, whether ultrasonic or optical, that works as reliably and quickly as I'd like. Moto nails it with their side-mounted sensor on the power button of some recent phones, and I loved what LG did when the had it in the center of the BACK of their phones. My glass screen protector is probably partially to blame, but the sensor wasn't perfect with the factory-applied TPU cover, either. This has prompted me to finally try face unlock, which Oneplus has done a good job with, admittedly.All in all, I love this phone. It is probably the best Android device I've owned, surpassing even the LG V30 and Samsung s10 5G, which were my favorites in their respective heydays. The Oxygen OS interface isn't as intuitive as stock Android, and some people really don't like recent incarnations of it, but I don't have a problem with it. Full disclosure: the first thing I do with any Android device is install Nova launcher and the same basic setup I've been using for several years, so manufacturers' launchers are irrelevant to me, but Oxygen OS is fine with me otherwise and Oneplus bloatware is minimal.6/5 stars, GREAT phone with very competitive pricing for what you get.",451,142,Cellphones,4.4,,19,0.36195
2023-07-12,True,5,"For years I bought used phones and used Virgin for not a lot of money. My needs changed so I picked up a Samsung habit and ATT was happy to feed me unlimited.I'm 65 and retired now so my needs have changed. My Note 10 plus works well but is dated and Samsung no longer provides support. I like to solve problems before they occur so I started researching a new phone a year ago. So many choices most of them good, but expensive out of pocket. Carriers are happy to help you get one so you can take on 30 months of high profit plans.This phone has a lot of good reviews and rightly so. Samsung S23 Ultra is awesome and really way more than I need at $1200.00.This is $800.00 and after a day can't find a flaw in fact it too is awesome.Blazing fast. Battery last. Long time. Recharges very fast. I never used wireless charging before so don't care this doesn't have it.The speakers are more than adequate that too I don't care about so much because I stream via Bluetooth.The camera I haven't used yet but I see it has dual camera mode for those that want to vlog in 8k. That is a big thing with reviewers and maybe me. I got rid of my DSLR because it's huge and went to Canon G7Xll which at 20 megapixels takes great photos. The Samung took great photos. This will take great photos.Audiophiles exist that study the nuance of every note. I'm not that guy. Saturation etc in photos isn't going to bother me much and I guess if it did editing will come in handy. They say the best camera is the one you have with you and this is it.Spend $800.00 for this phone/mini computer and it will get you through 5 years at least unless like a magpie you're attracted to shiny new things. Like me put a sim card in and you're ready to go. I live in Mexico now and use Telcel at $10.00 a month. Or spend $80.00 a month for the next three years for virtually the same thing here. This also has an esim which I haven't worked out yet. Doesn't look like Mint mobile recognizes this model yet.",451,142,Cellphones,4.4,,28,0.0001

(I use max cool color temp personally) No opinion:camera systems on everything over 150$ have good cameras these days.Cons:Glass back. Makes the phone hard to grip onto and caseless and it makes it slide everywhere till May 16-25th it's the 6th rn as of this edit. Seriously just put a thin plastic optionally tearable covering in the back. The tpu screen protector that comes on the phone should honestly be put on the back instead for grip.The curved screen is bad as it's almost impossible to get a screen protector on. and it also is easier to break from a fall. Can't have battery saver on when updating When in landscape and inside a game the notifications don't appear as normal and are a small one-line only. And I want the game tools they have so I have to deal with this, unfortunately.Personal cons:On-screen fingerprint sensor, used to the more accurate side-mounted ones. Plus sometimes screen protectors have annoying holes in them for the sensor.6.7 inches instead of 6.8 why you might ask? Well. The past 2 phones I had, a s22 I returned. (Samsung screwed me and didn't want me as a customer.) And a moto edge 5g UW 2021 were both 6.8 and they could have made the battery in the OnePlus 11 5100 milliamp instead of the 5000 if they did make the phone 6.8 inches. But that's just me. Final notes: If your gonna get a flagship Android phone that you want to last at least 2 or more years then get this if you want an OEM Android.As the pros far outweigh the cons. If you want stock Android go for a pixel or the 800$ moto edge+ 2023 or unlock the boot loader on this thing but I don't recommend that.",451,142,Cellphones,4.4,,77,0.0003
2023-07-27,True,5,"I am am long time smartphone user & one of those people that replaces their phone every year. I had the original OnePlus One, 2, 6, 6T, 7 Pro McLaren Edition & then I went to other brands eventually ending up with a Pixel 6 Pro, 7 Pro & I was getting the new phone itch again & started looking around. That's when I noticed somehow the glass in one spot over a lens on the back had broken & I never break phones. I had been reading about how much better the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 was over the Google Tensor G2, not only that, but my Pixel 7 Pro had 12GB RAM & 128GB storage. I went with the OnePlus 11 5G 16GB RAM & 256GB storage. It was actually a little cheaper than the Pixel 7 Pro was & honestly I'm shocked at how much of a superior phone it is as well! The screen is absolutely gorgeous QHD+ HDR10+ Dolby Vision! It even supports Ray Tracing in games which is crazy! The audio is unreal! Not only does is have Dolby Atmos, it also has Spatial Audio which is 360 degree sound & if your headphones support it will even auto adjust the sound scape to the orientation of your head! It is extremely fast, surprisingly faster than the Pixel 7 Pro! I have always liked Google phones for the latest updates as they're released, the pure Android experience & since the switch to their own SoC the Tensor G1 & then the G2 the AI features are incredible. Even with all that, I think I'm sticking with OnePlus from now on, because I am beyond impressed!",451,142,Cellphones,4.4,,17,0.0009
2023-05-30,True,5,"I don't know why people or other reviewers are so technically specific about this phone as compared to other phones of its type, but I decided to go ahead and get one. I am an owner of the Samsung S23 Ultra, which is a decidedly wonderful phone, but what I really love about this phone is the little things that Samsung does not do! To be honest I have had OnePlus phones in the past and I was thoroughly satisfied with them. I bought the Samsung S23 Ultra because I got a great deal on the storage upgrade, like the same price for the 512 GB as for the 256 GB, in which trade in from my old S22 I ended up paying only a few hundred dollars.With this phone (OnePlus 11) s's et up was incredibly easy and quick and I have over 120 apps on my phone! It just went so quickly that I had to keep checking to be sure it was actually working. The call quality is unbelievably good. Even when connecting it to my Wi-Fi, it went so quickly that it was scary!Now as for the camera quality. Like most people, I do not buy a smartphone just to take pictures and videos and I am certainly not Frederico Fellini. The picture quality is excellent even in close-ups and in darker situations. I think a lot of people even professional reviewers when it comes to cell phones have gotten just so picky and nitpicky that they miss the major points of whether or not it is just a device, because there's always a ""but""!People are sticking to the point that this phone only has an IP64 rating versus an IP67 or 68 rating. This phone does well in splash situations or rain, versus being able to submerge the phone like most people decide to stick a $1000 cell phone underwater to take pictures of fish anyway! It's a bogus point! Besides there are cases you can buy, waterproof cases, that can handle this if you do decide to go deep sea diving with your phone or are worried about it getting wet and falling out of your pocket in a pool or in the ocean. It's just a nonstarter for an issue.People also complained that it doesn't do wireless charging. With the charger, it comes with this thing and the ability to go from 0 to 100 in literally a matter of minutes who gives a damn about a wireless charger when you can easily put this charger/adapter in your pocket and use it anywhere there is electricity! Again another bogus point!For the price, simply put, this is an outstanding phone and it is clear I should have gotten this one instead of the S23 Ultra because from my viewpoint they are both equally as good.I'm loving it!",451,142,Cellphones,4.4,,78,0.0107
2023-07-27,True,5,"First let me say this phone is amazing. One plus is back. There will be people that have there loyalty to a product but my loyalty is to the company that makes a good product. One plus has again created a great phone with OP11. Top specs, great battery life and great build. I have had phone for about 10 days and it performs excellent. Had the Samsung S21 ultra which is a good phone like all Samsung top tear phones but OP is a flagship killer for it's prices, specs, and performance. Some people complain about wireless charging not be available but wit a battery that last like this there no need. 6.7 inch vs 6.8 inch is no contest. Smaller form factor makes it easier to used on hold. Adding back the slider for mute, vibrate, and sound is awesome. You can always nick pick any product but if you are looking for an exceptional smartphone at a great price OP11 is at the top of the android chart.",451,142,Cellphones,4.4,,2,0.0004
2023-04-24,True,5,"First off, a little background: I come from a previous line of Samsung phones. I have an iPhone for work, and am forced to use it.That said, I was looking to upgrade from my S20FE due to the device pushing 4 years old. I toyed around with the S23ultra and although the camera is pretty sweet, I couldn't justify all that extra money for a feature that isn't a core function of the telephone. What was left in the price range I wanted to stay in, was the Pixel 7 Pro, and this OnePlus 11 5G.  I opted to purchase the OnePlus with the 16gb of ram version, and I cannot complain at all about it. (I use Straight Talk's service btw, and it has better reception than the S20FE had.There are a couple small idiosyncrasies in this phone's UI that just ""feel"" odd, but I think it feels that way because I have become accustomed to Samsung's UI as being standard.Other than the very minor quirks that are normal for Oxygen OS, I have found NOTHING disappointing about this phone. The camera is absolutely fantastic, except the selfie camera takes ""colder"" looking pictures.Easy fix: install the gCam port.Now I use gCam for selfies, and the stock app for everything else.The charging rate of this phone is downright staggering in comparison to any iphone or Samsung or Google product, hands down.Also, it ACTUALLY CONES WITH A CHARGER. None of the flagships from the previous three manufacturers include even a crappy charger, let alone one that pushes EIGHTY WATTS🤯So do yourself a favor and compare this phone to the pricetag of any phone with a Snapdragon 8 gen2 processor, and also factor in the fact that it has 16 GB of ram, and it's no wonder the phone is so crazy fast and smooth. Go look up a 256gb S23ultra, then look for the 16gb ram option. There isn't one. Same chipset albeit an over locked version, but ""only"" 12gb of ram available. Couple that with the $1,100 pricetag, slow charging speed, no charger in the box, and now you'll see why the OnePlus 11 is such a huge value for your money. Did I mention OnePlus is now offering FOUR YEARS of Android updates? This this will be good through Android 17!!Honestly, it was a tough call between this and the Pixel 7 Pro because of the telephoto lens on the 7pro. But, the Tensor chipset is not exactly the most powerful thing on the block and struggles if put up against a serious gaming session. Also saw lots of reports where the rear camera glass was brittle and breaking during normal use, and Google wasn't covering it under warranty.This phone is the clear value champion of 2023.",451,142,Cellphones,4.4,,42,0.0002

I was a diehard Samsung Galaxy fan until this phone showed up at my house in a simple red box with little on it other than the number 11.I always watch reviews, guides and tips and tricks videos before I make a major technology purchase and this phone was no different but even after a few hours of hearing trusted technology advisors telling me this was a true flagship phone, I was still taken aback by the incredible value this phone is at this unheard of price point.Copying my S22 Ultra contents over to the 11 was pretty easy with the OnePlus Clone Phone app and it was fast.I've yet to through an app or game at this phone that it hasn't crushed and the 5G connectivity is a step above anything that I'm used to.The sidebar that I came to love on my Galaxy phones is not only here, it's easier to use and customize than it was on those phones.I can't find anything bad to say about the OnePlus 11 Pro, it's just one of those very rare times when ""Wow!"" accurately conveys the correct sentiment.",451,142,Cellphones,4.4,,19,0.5458

2023-04-30,True,5,"What an amazing smartphone. Hands down better than the ultras and pros on the market. Biggest selling point: full charge in 20-25 min. SD 8 gen 2 processor is blazing fast. The camera housing looks great and takes great photos. It probably won't beat pixel or s23 lineup but it takes great pics for its price and everything else it offers. The battery at 5000 mah lasts all day and if you forget to charge it overnight, it can charge while you get ready. 5-10 min and you're getting enough for the day  Samsung, Google, and Apple can't say that. I had a P7 and even though I liked the software and haptics, the slow charging was a deal breaker for me. OxygenOS is pretty great. Has loads of customization and OnePlus doesn't use as much bloatware as Samsung so it's probably the best android skin out there. It has great customization options and has nifty features like a screen off button (not double tap but in the drop-down menu), 3 finger screenshot, scrolling screenshot if you want the whole page, quick launch storage and calculator, etc.The phone is definitely my favorite OnePlus phone so far. That alert slider is handy too although I usually have it on vibrate so I don't use it often! Oh, and face and fingerprint unlock are so fast and accurate, even with a screen protector on. Dual speakers so it gets loud. The volume rocker and power button are on different sides so it's easy to differentiate the buttons unlike Samsung or Google. I included a few photos so you can see what it looks like. The case is Suknap and is the best case I've tried. Lastly, 80w charger in the box. Talk about the value king of 2023.

2023-06-24,True,3,I was initially amazed with the performance of this phone. I needed to take a video to show how the monitors were glitching on a train and send them back only problem was the camera on my phone kept freezing during the video for up to 5 seconds. Then after repeated attempts it would freeze and shut off. I downloaded several other camera apps and they all had similar issues so I'm guessing it's the camera itself. I need to take close up pictures for work and this camera struggles to get good close up pictures. Battery life and charging rates are this phones strong points it's nice to plug it in and have a full charge in less than 30 minutes. Overnight charging at the slow rate was problematic I set my alarm for 4 am and got up with 70 percent charge but didn't notice until I was at work with no chargers available and almost ran out of charge since I could never figure out why I turned off that feature. Overall it has been a good phone just wish the camera would work better I'm hoping the last update took care of it I haven't noticed it lagging lately.,31,21,Cellphones,4.4,,2,0.0008

So i decide i'd never buy an iphone ever again. So i was looking at other expensive options and narrowed my choice down to Samsung or this company. I chose this company due to the cheaper price than Samsung Ultra 23.  camera seems fine.  which is one of the reasons i upgraded to an expensive phone.  i also wanted more internal storage, that's another reason i purchased.  what i dont like about the cell phone and all cell phones is that when i put it in my jacket or coat pocket, the phone hurts my insides.  stomach, side, etc.  The cancer and reproductive harm risk is real.  Also when i have it in my hand a long time, i get pain as well.  due to that radiation risk, etc.  I was forced to buy a cell phone because its the way people use social media and connect, and post content, etc.  But I would prefer not to have a cell phone at all due to the cancer and reproductive harm risk, which is very clear with the pain i get when carrying it in my pocket and holding it in my hand.",31,21,Cellphones,4.4,,3,0.0203
2023-03-03,True,3,"Scrolling:Some apps like YouTube, Google pay, Prime Video etc.. are locked at max 60Hz refresh rate. In other apps where it actually supports 120hz refresh rate, the throttling is very agressive. This leads to a bad scrolling experience especially when compared to similar priced phones from Samsung. Having different scroll speed on different apps is very annoying and it only gets worse with time.Audio:Dolby Atmos only works with Bluetooth. No support on phone speaker and the deal breaker for me - no support on Android auto. So of you care about music quality while driving, look elsewhere.Haptics:Haptics mechanism itself is good overall. For some reason no way to enable haptics for home gesture. It works for back and recent gesture. This is very annoying.Charging:Very fast. Full charge under 30 mins. But you need to carry a OnePlus charger everywhere you go. Phone battery is good, so you can live with it.So the overall theme is that they are trying to make a fast phone, but the experience is NOT smooth. Come on OnePlus, you used to be better than Samsung!

The OnePlus 11 5G gave me problems from the beginning. It failed to recognize any usb connection to share files, and did not work with Android auto (since it wouldn't recognize any usb connection other than charging the phone). After doing some research, I found out how to get into the developer setting and enable the usb recognition, so my Android auto connection began to work, but the every time I turned the car off and on again, I would have to restart the phone and update the usb setting again before the phone would recognize the usb connection. It was too much hassle for something that should just work automatically.  I saw in some forums that this is also the case with their version 10 phone, so it must be an issue with their most recent OS.

Even if you turn on high performance and I'm not using this phone to play games. I'm using it to get work done. So simple stuff really. Apparently it seems impossible to remove the google home screen news widget on the far left side. All things google don't want to work well. Makes me want to get my 4 year old phone back out just to do basic stuff that works right. Going onto Google maps looking for tow trucks. First location wants to bug out and throw all my settings backwards like metric. Then when I try to view reviews, websites, etc looking for tow trucks it wants to crash. Show me nothing. This is running off home wifi. When I go to phone data it won't work at all. When something is time sensitive like looking up a tow truck for my vehicle sitting on the side of the road I don't need problems. Btw I'm not blaming this phone. One plus is legit. I'm blaming Google and Android snapdragon processor. It just updated to the newest version this morning. 13.1 I believe. They are never going to stop making all this new super fast hardware slow with all this new software malware. So it doesn't matter if you get this phone or a S23 cause it's the same instituted malware filled snapdragon processor and Android operating system and they will continue to max out its hardware with resource consuming software that way its never really an upgrade it's just a constant battle to stay with the times and draining your income.",47,36,Cellphones,4.4,,1,0.0001

On March 17 they sent me a return label, and I sent the phone back for repair a week or two later. It took more than a month for them to send a replacement phone. When I got the replacement on May 3, it was an 8GB/128GB model rather than the 16/256 I purchased. I immediately informed them of this fact. It's been almost a week and nothing has happened except a few e-mails saying that my case is being escalated and escalated again, to no apparent effect. (I haven't been pestering them; they've sent these emails unprompted.)I'm still hoping to get what I paid for, a working 16/256 OP11, but at this point it's not looking likely.

2023-03-03,True,1,"This phone's internal hardware is stellar, and the battery life is excellent. The cameras too are well done, but that's where the positive ends. The software is terrible (slow, buggy, and missing helpful features that previous versions of OxygenOS had) and is just ColorOS. But perhaps worse is the hardware decision to coat the phone in a teflon-like texture (on the black model; the green model doesn't have this issue.) This is without a doubt the most slippery phone I've ever held in my life – it's honestly somewhat impressive how slippery the phone is. Given how large, heavy, and rounded this phone is, it's honestly difficult to grip without a case (and I don't use cases.) I returned it as a result.Pros:- Super fast processor- Great fingerprint reader- More than adequate camera- Fantastic battery lifeCons:- Curved screen is a gimmick that makes gestures more difficult, increases glare, and increases fragility- Phone is too large and heavy- Black texture is INSANELY slippery- ColorOS simply is a bad Android skin.

Those three bands have serious speed in them. The main three carriers in the US and their mvnos utilize those bands for signal in their networks.

2023-03-03,False,4,"I purchased from OnePlus but decided to leave a review here as well. The phone's amazingly fast with a great design. Some are upset about the lack of wireless charging. I can understand that if you're used to it. I'm coming from a Oneplus 8t so never had it anyway. And going with USB 2 on this phone was a poor decision.UFS 4.0 with DDR5X RAM makes the phone very quick. The SnapDragon 8 Gen 2 handles everything I've thrown at it. The 2k screen is beautiful with great color, and it's bright.It seems OnePlus has listened to their customers and returned to their original high quality/low cost model that made them popular to begin with.I'm editing this from 5 to 4 stars because I have come to really dislike OxygenOS (OOS), which is really ColorOS with a different name for a different market. The last good version of OOS was 11 in my opinion. I'm sure OnePlus/BBK Electronics did this as a cost saving measure, but I believe it's driven away many long time customers. I'm currently looking at other operating systems to install on this phone. Being a new phone, there aren't many choices yet.Unrelated to the phone, but I've been seeing many reviews in Spanish all over Amazon that come from the USA. What's going on with that?",58,21,Cellphones,4.4,,1,0.0136
2023-02-21,True,2,"First impression is how beautiful the phone is. This was great because I'm not usually the kind of person who's big into the aesthetics. The only knock to that is the cameras take up such a big part of the phone and are pretty exposed. Kinda looks funky to me, but that's kinda how most phones are going. Because they are so exposed, they will definitely need extra protection there, which is difficult right now because the phone is so new and case choices are extremely limited or for preorder. This is also true at the moment for screen protectors. The weight of the phone is very pleasing as well, not too heavy but feels higher quality.The phone is obviously a beast hardware-wise and the cameras are great for a general user, but are absolutely not top of the line (but close). You can also set upto an additional 12gb of unused space for additional virtual RAM if you want even more speed.Another important thing is the phone is super slippery and hard to hold safely, especially with one hand. So again a good case will be definitely required unless you like smacking yourself in the face at night with it while lying down.Also keep in mind, no wireless charging, which isn't important for me, but if it is for you then keep that in mind. The battery otherwise it's nuts and barely moving. It charged from 20% to full before I even finished moving over my stuff from my old phone (one plus 7 lol), which btw was seamless and took about 20 minutes for ~30gb of data via the old cable.The main reason for losing two stars is that the One Plus launcher keeps freezing and locking up even after fully updating the phone and multiple restarts. Maybe I don't know the technology well, but I have to use the default system launcher and even then it's extremely buggy. The One Plus launcher still trys to turn itself on, so even though I have the other launcher set to default it breaks and freezes the whole phone every few minutes.All in all the phone is obviously still new, so we'll see how it develops. But for what you pay you get a killer phone able to compete with the big guys on *most* fronts and still save a couple hundred bucks.Assuming the UI bugs get fixed soon, I'd def give it 4.5-5 stars initially pending more usage.Edit 3/17: ended up returning it and removing a star. Not sure id recommend it anymore. Constantly buggy and getting worse. My battery immediately started draining crazy fast and would barely last one day. My calls started bugging out too and I had to reset my phone way too often just to make and take calls. Again, I want to give it more stars, I probably shouldn't even give it 2 stars but here we are. If you are in a slightly more remote area then I'd definitely stay away from this one. My old OnePlus 7 pro has better reception than this thing...",13,13,Cellphones,4.4,,14,0.0

For context I got the promotion where for $700 you got the 16gb + 256gb of storage, and even then I much prefer the moto device.

By doing some online investigation I learned that this is a common problem with OnePlus phones, as the back case is made of glass.  Several folks mentioned that the stress of carrying the phone in a pants pocket will flex the phone and cause it to crack.  Apparently OnePlus has a standard policy of not covering the repair for a cracked case, since it may be due to a dropped phone.  I'm disappointed that a nice phone like this has such a significant problem.  I've thought about fixing the phone with a replacement case, but I expect that one will crack as well (I do carry my phone in my pocket).

However now, they just copy the OS in cheaper Chinese phones (their parent company). So if you do not know how to install a Custom ROM / OS, I would not recommend this phone or brand in general (besides older used phones). They also have a pretty terrible history with making botched updates to their phones.The decision is yours, but in my honest opinion, phones have stagnated the last 3 years, and you'd be better off buying an older used phone than any new phone lol.

Signals are full, more than my Pixel 7 pro on T-Mobile, OnePlus 11 gets a full 5g bar signal, all the apps I put on are performing and flowing! To the reviewer that complain about the USB 2.0 instead of 3.0, is nothing wrong with it, plus in the box is a huge 80wats charger that can juice up a laptops or Chromebook super fast, it's not big deal if the cable is not USB C to USB C, it's a normal USB (2.0) to USB C ( 3.0) you'll be dumb if you have to turn this phone for this simple fact! Plus, the wireless charging, how many really use it? Let's be real! Anyway, the pictures, are better than my Pixel 7 pro! Way better! Not a perfect camera phone but not even Sony Experia has it so perfect! As a wrap, it's the perfect phone, battery is well over a full day! Charges super quick! Dual stand by SIM cards ( yes Verizon on 5g too) and 256gb with 16gb RAM?! My Pixel 7 pro came with a 12gb ram and 128gb rom, at a price about 300 more dollars than OnePlus 11 5g! Folks, this is a beast!",451,142,Cellphones,4.4,,59,0.0007
2023-02-22,True,5,"Overall I'm loving the OnePlus 11 so far! It really feels like a flagship device, but without the ludicrous flagship price tag. It's not a perfect phone, but delivers on the aspects that matter most to me: Performance, screen quality, and battery life + charging speed. The phone doesn't skip a beat with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, and up to a whopping 16GB RAM. Gorgeous screen with 1440p resolution and buttery 120Hz that dynamically scales down to save battery. Speaking of which, the battery experience is wonderful. I'm seeing 1.5-2 days of regular use before needing to charge back up, which takes less than 30 mins!The phone does have some shortcomings however: No wireless charging, IP64 instead of IP68, USB 2.0, decent cameras that are overshadowed by the competition, and finally a very different UI experience compared to OxygenOS of the past. These are all sacrifices that I'm willing to make given the price point of the phone.Conclusion: It's a well rounded flagship level phone that makes smart compromises in order to justify a more reasonable price. For the money it's hard to find a better value in terms of sheer hardware specs than the OnePlus 11. Although not quite the ""flagship killer"" we used to know, this showing is certainly a step in the right direction.",451,142,Cellphones,4.4,,18,0.0003
2023-03-03,True,5,"This is my first OnePlus phone, and dare I say this the best experience I've had with a cellphone. It's not a perfect phone, but it specs deliver in the areas that matter: Excellent battery (I get 1.5 days of use before I need to charge it again) plus the charging speed is amazing, great screen quality and the performace of the processor is great. This phone with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, 16GB RAM simply rocks. Great screen resolution and smooth 120Hz that can dynamically scale down. The cameras are ok, a lot better than the ones my other phones had. Oxygen OS is ok as well, somewhat different from other experiences I've had but it's nice.The phone has some cons that to me are that important: No wireless charging (not really necessary with supervooc charging), IP64 instead of IP68, USB 2.0. But given the price point of this phone, this cons can be overlooked.Conclusion: It's a must get.

2023-03-28,True,5,"I've been utilizing the OnePlus 11 with 16GB of RAM, and I have never encountered a phone that can switch between different applications so fast without having to reload them. Additionally, the battery life is the best I've ever encountered, and as a bonus, the phone can be fully charged in 20 minutes or less. Because of the battery life and the extremely fast charging speed, I do not believe I will ever switch to any other phone brand. The facial recognition works perfectly, even in low lighting conditions, based on my experience. You get an excellent value for your money with this phone, and I recommend it to anyone who is considering it but undecided. If you decide to purchase this phone, I highly suggest the poetic revolution case on Amazon, which, in my opinion, is just as good as OtterBox.

It’s about the same size as a penny and the letter in the center is very tiny compared to the display pictures.

Lots of fun gesture features and the screen is very good.  Crystal clear and good colors.  The camera is meh, though.  If they could put a better camera in future phones that takes pictures similar to Pixel/AAPL/Samsung, then you'd have an amazing winner.  Just to note, it is rather large for a phone.

Yes this model isn't 5g but i didn't care for that as i wanted to either fix the screen of my moto edge which i broke the first day i got (fell out the car) but i used it till earlier this April 13th and i got that phone on 1/10/23.One advantage is i have up to 512gb micro SD storage if i shall please and that's something i didn't have with the old phone. So i lost NFC payments, big deal cause I rarely used that feature anyways.As for the fingerprint sensor, it works flawlessly on the moto g stylus but i did have much trouble with it on the edge.Battery life on this phone is great. I don't expect it to last forever but it last me easily an entire day and not two days like promised but then again I'm on this phone constantly.Screen is great, same as the moto edge 2021 i had same screen actually.This is a nice phone, if you don't care for 5g, but want a good phone at the current price of $169 it can't be beat which is why I jumped on it and with additional credit i had on my Amazon account my total cost for this phone was $121 i couldn't resist it. I have no regrets and love this phone. I also loved the moto edge but this one is just as good technically a downgrade from what I had but still good.I would recommend this phone.

While yes, there are other uses for the stylus and paintng with the stylus is fun, it just wasn't going to be useful enough to me without functional writing.

I've been told when people call me, it doesn't even ring, but goes straight to voicemail.  So, I just purchased a new phone yesterday after only having this one for 6 months.

Now in general I love Motorola phones so it's nothing against Motorola for this particular model with it not being 5G and an urban setting it doesn't do very well compared to 5G phones I'm guessing but from what I understand it could be that it's fighting for bandwidth I could be wrong. All of this have had connection issues more one kind or another compared to our prior phones but it certainly isn't the worst phone I've ever had them misfortune of using and I would gladly still stick with Motorola.,124,37,Cellphones,4.3,,1,0.0059

If you buy this phone make sure to buy the extended warranty because the battery MIGHT last you a year before it needs replacing.  The cameras are also not really as described. Very blurry and hard to adjust.  Video is better than photo.  One little annoying thing.  The Ringer and Notification setting are together so if you want to turn off notifications you wont hear your phone ring either.  Really stupid, but all Motorola phones are this way.

You can tell you are working with a value phone if you have used a premium one in the past. And my 3 year plus old phone speed tested much better than the stylus. That being said I found it to be a great value overall. The reason I ended up returning it was due to ongoing issues with getting pictures, videos, and attachments in messages.

First off, the good.  The battery is awesome.  I sometimes will get a full two days from a charge and that is with fairly heavy use.  I listen to pod casts pretty much all day while working.  The camera is very good.  I love the big screen.  Volume is better than the galaxy.  There are other features that I also like, a few not as good as the galaxy, but no big deal on those.  The price was a major plus as well.  The two major things that really bug me about this phone is that is can be glitchy - sometimes it will freeze for a few seconds, or just randomly close apps... Things like that.  The ONE major showstopper though is that it often loses wifi and data connection.  It will sometimes randomly disconnect from my home wifi and cannot reconnect when others around me are on with no problems.  Sometimes I will have no phone service when others do who are on my same Verizon family plan.  Sometimes I will be places that I never had a problem with service before and will have no service.  *Sometimes* restarting the phone will temporarily fix the issue, but it doesn't last.

2023-08-08,True,4,"I've been a Moto phone buyer for a while now. They usually have a good price/performance ratio, okay reliability, and low levels of bloat with a mostly stock Android experience. This phone does everything I need it to, and does it pretty quickly thanks to the 6GB RAM. The relatively large internal storage also means that I shouldn't really have to offload stuff, other than maybe photos/videos, to an SD card.All the basic features work pretty well. Good reception, decent speaker, fast GPS, etc. Very few real complaints with this phone. Battery life is just okay. I used to have an older G Power with a massive battery, with a very long battery life. This G Stylus still has good enough battery life, especially if you ""trim the fat"" a bit, app-wise, and listen to music more often than watching HD videos. Days where I spend a lot of time watching stuff often leave me with 10-20% battery by bed time.However, nothing really stands out as amazing about it. I've never owned a flagship phone, so I don't know if there's some magical experience there, but this Moto phone is perfectly adequate for basically everything other than maybe extreme graphics applications/gaming. It's a great deal at under $200, in my opinion.Now if Moto/Lenovo would just make their phones easily serviceable, I'd wholeheartedly recommend them. Planned obsolescence sucks. Just make the USB-C port and the battery replaceable and I'd sing Moto's praises to the world.Did you know that officially the USB C port is actually rated for fewer insertions than Micro USB? Sure, that's partly a limitation of making it reversible (more pins in a similar form factor) but it also means, gee golly, our phones will break even faster. I wonder why the standard was adopted so quickly? It's too bad that phones are essentially expensive disposable toys these days.Basically, this Moto phone is me making the best of a bad situation.",266,48,Cellphones,4.3,,11,0.0001

(Right up there with our Pixel and Samsung phones.)Setting it up was simple and using it was no different than our other Androids.AND then... I took it out to the car. It does not play well with Android Auto. And Waze did not function well on it at all. (GPS worked intermittently; the pointer jumped around on the map.) But Maps had no issues, so it's not the phone's actual GPS that was a problem.In fairness, I did NOT try to troubleshoot or correct the problems.I never did contact Motorola or the app developers for help.If I didn't use Android Auto or Waze, this phone would have been perfect, even for my main phone.It is a very nice phone!",266,48,Cellphones,4.3,,0,0.1736

I saw many tech review sites call it a sideways model, but that it was a decent budget phone, and I agree, it is decent, but there are a few things I wouldn't say I'm happy about. The battery life that most are talking about as the only improvement is slightly better than the 2020 one, but only on low usage. Running battery-intensive apps like TikTok drain it just as fast. And because of its slow charging, compared to how fast the 2020 charged, I wouldn't call the battery an improvement. Next is that the phone altogether feels cheaper. Compared to the 2020 model, the startup animation feels outdated, the exterior looks a little cheaper, and the top bar that includes the time, wifi, battery etc. is spaced poorly if you're a UI stickler like me. And finally, the camera quality is significantly worse in low light situations. The 2020 model isn't great, but is still much better. It's also taller than the 2020 model, which I don't like, but that's personal taste. If you get past those things, it's a good phone.",266,48,Cellphones,4.3,,49,0.003

Also, it does not automatically download tik tock. They had to have done it while in YouTube.I started out with android phones and moved to Apple about eight or so years ago. I think back then security updates were a new thing for Android and it was impossible to get a security update for LG phones.So I switched over.I'm happy with the Apple phones, but after all these years I was wondering what android was like these days. Not wanting to spend a lot of money to find out and get as clean an android as possible ( minimal bloat ware) I did some research and picked this Moto G Stylus.This is about as clean an android you're going to get. Aside from a few Moto apps ( note taker and user guide) there's no bloatware. You'll have to do the usual privacy setting adjustments in Google to your liking, otherwise, I've been really liking this phone. The bigger screen is nice for reading. Reviews were gripeing about processor performance but this phone has been pretty quick. To me a phone is a tool not a toy, so I can't mention anything about playing games.The way android works with Google calendar and notifications is much nicer than the way Apple does it. Most common functions are built into iOS and here they are apps but everything has been working fine.The battery has been excellent. My use is; phone calls, texting, internet use, you tube, Kindle and Amazon music. If I took it off the charger Monday morning at 9am, I'll easily have 30+ percent left on Tuesday night. Sometimes more with light usage.I haven't gone back to the Apple phone and been enjoying discovering the available apps and how android works.If you're looking for a good budget phone, I'd pick this over the budget Samsungs.

I added another fingerprint, added face unlock, added to keep it unlocked at home, and with all that unlocking is passable. I'd still probably get this phone again, but the unlocking issue is annoying. Battery life is still great though, most of the time I get two days.Original review: I went from a 2019 flagship, the LG G8 to this phone. In theory, I shouldn't have. This has mid-range specs and I lost out downgrading from a flagship, even if it is 3 years old. However, I think phones are now as exciting as toothbrushes. They are pretty much just there to do a job, and if they do the job, then who cares? I can only notice the slightest occasional difference in day-to-day performance with this phone from the LG. The camera is slightly worse in low light. But it is pretty much the same. The screen on this phone is great, and I'm glad it's a 90hz screen, but I honestly can't tell the difference from 60hz. The stylus is fun occasionally, and it's nice to have OS and security updates, at least for a while. The battery life and large screen are the main reasons I got this phone.

There's just too much Google involved in the system... including a couple of minor kinks. Hopefully updates will solve them.It's a quick system, plenty of storage and expandable.All in all, for an under-200 dollar phone you'll do ok.Oh...and you can make phone calls too.UPDATE - 3-24-2023:If you bought the phone and like, go ahead and purchase an extra stylus.

I like the increased performance I'm seeing. The battery lasts me about 24 hours before hitting 15%. Fingerprint unlock is fine with the power button acting as the reader instead of a circular reader on the back of the phone. My pictures and video appear to be sharper than that I was able to get out of my g7, but of course not what you'd find in a high end phone. This is my first phone with a facial recognition unlock and that also seems to work just fine for me. The stylus is an unexpected pro. I like having one permanently onboard as it helps me navigate my email and calendars much more easily than my thumbs ever did. Any cons are just around me adjusting to the slightly new interface. The ""back"" icon I'm so used to is now a back swipe from the right side of the screen. The zoom feature on the camera requires a little more finesse than my fat fingers like, but I'm learning how to use it. Overall, it's a solid 4G LTE phone for those of us who like an unlocked phone that can work with GSM or CDMA carriers. If the phone lasts for three years as my g7 did, I would consider this a five star phone.",266,48,Cellphones,4.3,,73,0.0009
2023-05-27,False,3,We have three of these almost two years old. Good phone except for outside. The screen is nice except for outside which it is horrible. In the sun you will totally lose all viewing of what's on the screen. Phone 1 my screen blacks out sometimes during calls and I have to restart it to get it back. Phone 2 the charging port is going out. Phone 3 battery doesn't hold a good charge anymore and the screen is ghosting bad. After 2years  phones 1and 2 have to be charged twice a day with minimal use. Phone 3 three times a day. Overall I give the phones a 3 star rating. It would be 4 if the phones could be used outside.

2023-02-25,True,1,"I'm upgrading from a 2020 Moto G Power, a phone I loved for it's battery life and hated  every time I tried to use it outside.  The display had to be set to 100% to use inside and was almost unusable in bright light. The 32 gig of memory was also limiting so being otherwise satisfied with the Moto g series of budget phones I shopped for a replacement.I liked the price of the Moto G Stylus and the specs suggested an improved display over the Power, 90hz vs 60hz ,Max Vision Full HD+ vs HD, and has the same 5000mAh battery. Didn't care one way or the other about the stylus just considered it a bonus.After purchase and setup of the Stylus ,I was immediately disappointed with the display.  There was absolutely no difference when I compared the Stylus side by side with the Power.  No improvement whatsoever. Again very dim display that needed 90% brightness to be usable indoors and the difficult outside view was the same.If the display were ANY better at all I would have given this phone 5 stars.  Everything else is very good for a budget phone, and the retractable stylus and associated software are easy to use . I'll never use it for more than jotting notes but I like having it.  This is a budget phone and being familiar with the Moto G line I don't think I'm being too rough when I say the glaring flaw of this phone is the display.Update:I thought the display was the major flaw but now I have to add that battery life is horrible.

Yet this phone that's several years newer... Awful.Horrible battery life. Especially if you watch any video based media on it like Instagram reels, YouTube, Twitch streams, and TikTok too. Even using it casually drains the battery like crazy. I only had to charge my old phone overnight then it'd be perfect through the day, even until ~4am. I watched tons of videos throughout the day on that thing too.It's also way too dependent on Google and their products. Another thing is if you swipe the screen to the left while you're on the home screen it brings up some random media and news that I don't care about. Can't disable that mess either. Customization is pretty low too. Not to say it doesn't have any but compared to other androids I feel somewhat restricted in what I can do.I have other complaints but let's leave it at that.

2022-10-20,True,1,"Ordered this Moto G Stylus 2022 in both the blue and the pink. They both showed up with half charged batteries. No worries, right? Just a quick charge to get the batteries to full and then start porting SIM card # info.Welp.The blue Moto took about an hour to get to full. The pink took over 5 hours. And never got to more than 92%. Yikes.So, I'll admit, I am an iPhone snob. These were intended for my two pre-teen children. Apparently Motorola must've known that b/c they decided the phones had to have Tictok, Facebook, and a bunch of other garbage apps upon initial activation. No biggee, right?Welp.So, we're coming from a Mint Mobile family plan. You must activate the SIM cards using the Mint mobile app; there is not other way to activate the phone. So I turn off the auto-download of all the garbage apps so I can get the Mint mobile app to do the single thing I care about doing. Nope. Immediately after cancelling the auto-download app downloads, they would immediately recommence downloading the garbage apps. Unreal. Is this a universal Android thing, or did I just have too high expectations for cheapo entry-level Android devices. So now I can't get the single app I need to make this phone an actual phone until all the other garbage downloads. Sheeesh.Sent them both back. Had to spend 2-3x more to get my kids into low-end iPhones, but at least I won't have to concern myself with bricked batteries and Tictok overriding my druthers on my children's phones.There were a number of other shortcomings as well, but not worth any more of my time in telling all of you that you should prob stay away from these devices if time, patience, value, and frictionless phone experiences are something you are seeking.",120,72,Cellphones,4.3,,12,0.0001

Unfortunately, the issue persists. This morning went from 100% charge to 48% with ~2hours of light use (reading articles on web browser) Battery does not function as advertised. Quick to drain, slow to charge.Another massive negative is that this phone automatically downloads a Chinese spy-ware app (tiktok) when setting up. Will not be purchasing from Motorola in the future due to this.This is not an upgrade over my 2019 moto g(7) which I will be using until I replace with a non-moto device.Do not buy this if you expect a full day's use off of a single charge.

I started opening apps at the same time with both phones and it only loaded slightly faster. The camera quality is also MUCH WORSE and doesn't have the option to film horizontally while holding the phone vertically like it's 2020 predecessor.

Features that I looked for specifically from experience were: Removable SD card (wait until your built in one fails and learn), Camera Quality, Battery life, Streaming speed and video speed (the processor's ability to handle a load), control over carrier.

But almost like clockwork they start to fail after just about two years. You should expect to replace them every two years. In one case the screen started to go crazy, in another the power connector became so unreliable you couldn't charge the phone. In this G Stylus, at 26 months, it's starting to do weird things, like lose wifi connectivity, apps not working, and the USB-C port starting to need to be jiggled to get a connection. So time for a new phone. Another telltale sign of Motorola subtly telling you your phone is running on borrowed time is that they stop providing updates for the Android version: this G Stylus is on an Android version that is almost a year old and they say it's ""current.""

What is the super annoying issue? This phone has gotten rid of the little arrow in the lower left of the screen for going ""back"". Instead, you swipe from either the left or right edge of the screen to go back. And it's WAY too sensitive. Pretty much any time I try to just scroll left or right it interprets it as a ""back"" command unless I make extra sure to swipe from the dead center of the screen. So, if you were reading an article, you'll now have to start over. There's also no more little circle button at the bottom center of the screen to go back to the home screen either.

A surprisingly awsome camera for the money!  A surprisingly good screen for the money! And surprisingly good ram and storage for the money!  The processor is also surprisingly good for the money. All in all, it is probably about the best budget class high tech phone you can get... at least it was when I researched and purchased. Got one for me and one for the kid and strongly thinking about getting another just in case spare.Update after two months of use:The only actual real negative I can attribute to this model is that there are no aftermarket camera lens protector covers that are designed in a way that they don't fall off way too easily! Why can't a lens cover be made so it's held on by the phone case fitting over it? Other than that... Android 11 is not necessarily better than 10. But that isn't about the phone so much as the OS. I still believe it is a better phone than most. Especially if you want a none 5G one. Or live where there is no 5G. So far as I know.

The FHD camera is nice but 4k would have been better. Only thing I don't like is apps can not be stored on the SD card but 128gb internal is more than enough for what I need for app storage. Does not come with a good dedicated gallery app but there are good gallery apps in the Google Play store free and purchase. Comes with Android 11 which allowed me to upgrade a lot of my apps and I believe this phone will get 1 Android upgrade to Android 12 in the near future with 2 years of security updates. 6.8 FHD screen shows clear sharp colorful movies.

The stylus is largely pointless, although my fingers seem to struggle with this phone more, I'm chalking that up to adjustment to a new phone. Extra features include a poorly made coloring book for the stylus that ultimately just mostly fills in with one color. So worse battery life and no real need for the stylus.

My trusty note 5 was a wonder for the 7 years it lasted. Android system stopped updating at android 7. Storage was only 32 GB/4 ram memory which was probably a lot 7 years ago. The battery started draining faster and it kept rebooting itself frequently. No troubleshooting fixed it. The moto g stylus does almost everything the note 5 did but not as well. Almost everything involves using Google account. Had to navigate numerous settings to get to what I like. Face recognition is really great but only works half the time so I use pin as finger print set up did not like my dry skin fingers. The chop, chop gesture for flash light was cool but stopped working after several uses. Mostly wanted another stylus as I use for on the fly notes. Pen is NOT as good as Samsungs but better than nothing. Everything transferred over via Google account. Only Samsung notes and pictures of my contacts flowed over. I have not yet found a way to connect a photo to my contacts which uses google. One thing I don't like is it mixes my Alexa reminders with text messages. Not separated like samsung. To its advantage it has a bigger battery which lasts longer but..no fast charging. Limited to 10 watt charger. No wireless charging but it does have SD card for extra storage and headphone jack which many higher end phones are doing away with. If you know what you need and do your research, this phone is a great value. It will not get updates for 5 years like Samsung phones but cost so much less and meets my needs.

Unless I accidentally reviewed a different, earlier computer that I bought from Amazon. I've been pretty happy with the cheaper machines I've purchase through Amazon, but those tended to burn out in a year or two. They were on sale. I don't recommend buying a desktop computer on sale anymore, they tend to be gone and unusable after a short period of time. In my case, I use them an awful lot for social media, school, other things. So it may be overuse on my part. Still, I think the larger hard drives you get when you spend $1,000 or more on a desktop or laptop are a good idea.

We had a bubble station called the Bibidi Babidi Boo station and the kids could take a wand and blow bubbles. It was a super cute idea and was a hit with the toddlers. They all wanted their own wand. The quantity of 200 wands is a lot for a kid's party and we had a ton leftover. The different colors of the wants made it more colorful and fun.

What we didn't figure on was kids of ALL ages wanting bubbles! These aren't huge containers, which is good because even if they are spilled or they leak, the mess is minimal. They did still work to blow bubbles, though, and the kids enjoyed them. They were packed well, with no leakage during shipping, and all bubble containers were full when we received them.

The only issue I have is that the wands are so small that it's a little hard to get good bubbles.  Adults or older children who can really manage a light blow will do ok.

The oven itself is a mix of plastic interior frame and cardboard exterior. I could see that getting torn up when a kid plays with it. The plush takes four AAA batteries included and after unwrapping the set is ready to play.To start you get two 'dough' packets, a measuring cup, a spoon, and a mold. They don't give you a mixing bowl and since materials are not food safe I'd say use a disposable. The dough when mixed has a yeasty smell to it which was cool and it had the crumbly consistency of pie crust. I experienced no issues or irritation as in the other review. I molded the dough easily and put the shape in my oven (Note, when you see your mold you'll already know what animal you got which is kind of disappointing and ruins the reveal moment a bit.)There are tabs to remove under the oven and one inside it on the roof, after that you put the molded dough in, turn the knob and it starts ticking. You can hear it slide down into place which... again kind of ruins the magic a bit but after a minute and a half the oven meowed and I opened it to find a very vanilla scented plush!Pros:CuteAffordableThe smells are nice!The cat does get warm but only on a section of its backThe reveal effect workedBatteries included!Includes a bag to keep your doughAllows you to reset the oven to do the reveal baking again and again!Cons:Cat plush is understuffed and not cuddly because of a HUGE battery box inside it.No bowl includedOuter oven is cardboardSounds and interactivity with the plush is pretty limited. Maybe 4 different sounds are all I've heard.If your child is irritated by the dough I'd make the swap to a can of Play-doh.

There are a few slight differences. For example the hand bells. The construction and sound is superior in this set then the bells in the Looikoos set. The drum also sounds a tad richer. This set has a flute that is adequate, but could be better in clarity and picking up the notes. If you are buying for the flute, keep looking.  The other set came with a xylophone that offers a nice rich sound that you don't get with the plastic toys and this set did not have a xylophone to compare it to. Last, and this is a super small detail. This set has a nice cotton carrying bag and limited packing materials. It was thoughtfully out together to minimize waste.

This wire could easily pop the rest of the way out and cut my daughter. This is clearly a manufacturing defect, so I reached out to the seller through the Amazon function to contact a seller. They asked for an order number, so I explained to them that I do not have one due to receiving it as a gift and even sent a picture of the entire set to show which product I have (shown in the other picture). However, they refuse to help without an order number.

All three ""voices"" are super dirty, almost to a fault. In fact, this is the reason it only gets 4 stars from me. Tapping the headphone out into a signal processor, then out from *that* via headphones, I noticed that *somehow* it's giving off a microphonic signal. For example, if I run my fingernail down the speaker grill (like the washboard in a jug band), it's distinctly noticeable. Why this is happening is a mystery. Nevertheless, as I said, everything else about it works great and was exactly what I thought it'd be.As a quick side-note, it's ultra plastic-y. Not fragile, per se.

2017-04-05,True,4,"An interesting instrument. Monotones are made by pressing down on certain areas with the stylus (attached). I am a practicing musician of 10 years and always enjoy playing around with new instruments. One thing I'll say: don't let the video ad have you think that this produces some loud, rocking sound. By itself, it makes an 8-bit videogame-like note. The sound itself is responsive and the device overall is easy to use and eventually, with some practice, you can figure out a number of different tunes. However, its not a rich sound by any means. It has 3 different presets for sound, and a 3.5mm jack to play different music files and what not through its built in speakers. Also has a headphone jack. I personally think, outside of toying around by yourself, that this instrument has less applications in a jam setting; unless you're band mates all using these! It's a fun toy for the money, but non-musicians/enthusiasts may get bored after awhile. The price is very fair.

It's not even a true reconstruction of that device, because instead of the original transistor design, it uses very low quality samples to produce its organ sounds. As a result, you now get 3 different sounds instead of 1, but the sound quality has definitely taken some hits. The original stylophone actually sounded pretty decent when you plugged it into a good speaker, but with this remake, doing so just makes the the ugly aliasing of the samples way more apparent. The built in speaker seems to hide the artifacts fairly well though.

You play notes with the attached metallic stylus, which connects with the similarly metallic keyboard (As is the case, no you cannot use your fingers on this lil bud,) and you'll quickly find that you gotta be firm with the stylus. You can't just be wishy-washy on notes and just hold the stylus lightly, cause the keys aren't going to be able to read a firm enough connection.Likewise, its going to be very difficult switching notes and especially sliding at first without getting a little disconnecting crackle from leaving the previous note, but soon enough you'll figure out how to easily slide through notes, seamlessly like a proNow the last neat part of this pal is the tuner on the back. At first, it seems to be in an odd spot, and, again, if you haven't played around with these kinds of things, you're going to be confused, but this dial is more meant for giving a little pitch bend to your note, also allowing for you to go a few notes higher or lower than the established range. If you are planning to jam with some pals and not just play around on your own, dootin' some notes, this dial is gonna be essential to droppin' some styleNow, in my experience so far, I've found the best way to play is by holding the device length wise in your hand (so sideways along your hand,) that way you can easily move your thumb and index finger for not only the pitch dial, but the volume wheel and the vibrato switch, and then, to train at this, I pull up basically any artist who does synth stuff, and I start just hitting some background pitches and doin' whatever I want to match with the stuff.It takes training, and its definitely more of a background instrument than one that can take a solo like a champ (at least, thats what my experiences have yielded so far, maybe I'll fine a way)All in all, absolutely love this thing, gonna be messin with it for a good while",6518,922,Musical Instruments,4.6,,6,0.0
2022-12-26,True,5,"I gave this to my daughter as a gift and at first I was pleasantly surprised with how easy she was able to learn to play it. There are numerous YouTube tutorials showing how to play it. What I was not expecting is how often she would be playing it. After the 20th attempt to play “Never going to give you up” I was happy to see the batteries died.  The unit is very light and portable. It has a very pleasing analog sound.

2010-01-21,False,3,"To the uninitiated, the Stylophone makes a predictable impact when given to adults or children. When first opened the recipient of this gift is slightly baffled and wonders how to work this rather unwieldy 'pocket electronic organ.' It's easy enough to figure out and (after inserting batteries) users can tap out a tune of sorts much to the amusement of onlookers. As far as long term interest goes, any toy with lights and sounds tends to get picked up and played so in that respect the toy is a success. One negative aspect of this product is that it doesn't turn itself off like many toys with sensors do these days. Also, the sound it produces is pretty wretched -- even the children say as much. However, it's fun, durably built, has a volume control and comes with an MP3 input so it can be played along with any song and, mercifully, has a slot for plugging in headphones.",547,97,Musical Instruments,4.6,,16,0.0002

2015-08-20,True,3,"I bought the Stylophone for one simple reason: to do musical ear training with a small gadget I could take with me anywhere I go. It does this job quite well. What I did not realise is that you cannot play chords because of the nature of the instrument: the stylus is connected to a wire as you can see on the picture, so when you touch the metal keyboard with the metal-tipped stylus a circuit is created which activates the sound-producing circuit. To play a chord you would need a minimum of 2 styli, each connected with a wire. For now, at the outset of my training I need no chords. For later I will probably have to buy a Melodica which is bigger but does not need batteries. Before you use the Stylophone for ear training you should check the pitch which can be adjusted with a knob on the back next to the battery compartment.",547,97,Musical Instruments,4.6,,1,0.0003
2016-11-03,True,5,"This instrument is indeed entertaining and will serve its purpose. The shipping was earlier than I anticipated for which I applaud. The condition and durability however, is quite vulnerable in terms of cosmetics. Upon opening, I discovered that the metal board was already slightly pre-scratched which doesn't bother me as much but the board will accumulate more scratches regardless of how delicately the stylus is used. The Stlophone logo covered by the film will lose its chrome finish upon moist abrasion such as sweat leaving black marks where the letters are. The switch for the three different sounds requires more force to move than the power or vibrato switches. Be careful not to bring electronics such as phones near the Stylophone when it is in operation for it will generate static. The tuning peg at the back is easy to access and offers smooth turning. The MP3 and headphone jacks allow more ease of access and private use as well. Sound is not an issue because the device has an integrated speaker which can reach very loud sounds. The device is also constructed of a durable plastic disregarding the flexible speaker cover but is also prone to scratches. Voice modulation one is also flatter than the other modulations. Some overall modifications I would like to see is the vibrato switch replaced with a button of some sort and the voice option switch to be easier to move. Overall, the purpose of the instrument is well served and at an appealing cost as well. I look forward to doing more business in the future.",6518,922,Musical Instruments,4.6,,24,0.0027

There is a tuning potentiometer as well as a 3 octave selector which gives the unit some range (although not very dynamic). HOWEVER, the electronics are so cheap and low quality, there is a +-10Hz offset between the low and high pitches within an octave - a full semitone of difference in the lower octave - which makes this product basically unusable for most musical purposes. I didn’t expect a real synth for this price but getting tuning right shouldn’t be this hard.The sound quality is also terrible, there is no way to control the waveform (except for the vibrato) and the sound is very noisy and muddy because it is modulated by the contact of the stylus with the board,In short, it’s pretty cool to show off an annoy people with, but I wouldn’t consider it for music making.",175,54,Musical Instruments,4.6,,0,0.0001

It's mono so one note at a time, but when you slide ( instead of lift) the stylus between notes you get a note switching effect unique to this instrument. Run this THROUGH a synth and the sky is the limit. I really really like this. If you are thinking about a Korg monotron, well I have two and I like one of them.

2015-07-21,True,1,"In a world of circuit bending geekazoids who absolutely LOVE products like this one (promises to be,) finding one they haven't heard of or aren't familliar with creates a sort of Pavlovian response to take out the wallet and enter credit card numbers. Like I did. I must own half a dozen devices like this- but mostly made by a very reputable manufacturer of musical instruments and synthesiszwers: Korg. Check out the line of Korg Monotrons. There are three: Monotron, Monotron Duo and Monotron Delay. In a fight, a Monotron that has been run over by a cement truck could kick this thing's teeth in. Let's start with the fact that when mine arrived, it didn't work. At all.So- knowing what I am doing, I opened it up to see if it wwas a simple thing, like the wire connecting the batteries to the circuit board had come loose during transport. Nope. All simple problems checked out negative. Then I started to REALLY examine the PCB: the Printed Circuit Board. (They are called that because they actually are ""printed"" like a home paper and ink printer, only on a much different kind of printer, with much different kinds of paper and ink. The PCB was of the lowest quality I have seen in anything made post 1965. The connections and wires showed signs of corrosion (copper turned green). The unit had signs of (but I have no proof of) water damage. Even the box looked like it had been submerged in water, then left in the sun to dry.

Make sure there is a note in the order that the unit is for me. Please do not purchase this item again under a different name.Huh. That's weird.Why? I asked. Is it because if I order another, you'll make sure to give me one from the ""good"" pile? Are you getting rid of defective units via Amazon, refusing exchanges and intentionally turning people off from buying from you again, in order to keep getting rid of damaged units?IMMEDIATE ANSWER. Of course not. I got a one in a million damaged unit. They have no idea why it had so many problems. And at the time I wanted an exchange, they were waiting for more inventory (even though they seemed readily available here)So I asked to talk to someone else at the company. A boss, maybe? Told me that it was a single person operation. Then I checked on that. Ummmm.... no. They have a HUGE website with all sorts of products geared toward so called ""geeks.""

2013-06-02,True,1,"I would be okay with the quality, if mine worked correctly. I see it as a fun toy for my piano students to experiment with. However, the keys must play the correct tones to be of any use to me at all. The keys are labeled with numbers, the ""white"" keys being whole numbers from 1-12 and the ""black keys"" being 1.5 thru 11.5. When I play up the entire scale chromatically it works fine until I get to number 7 which should sound a ""G"" tone, but plays an ""F"" instead. The same thing happens when I play from top to bottom, 7 sounds like 6. Sometimes 7 & 6 are the same, unless you hit the 7 again and then it behaves like 7. Is this getting confusing? Does it even matter? Something is wrong with the electronics because 7 has a different tone depending on which tone you play before it. The pitch problem is inconsistent but lies centered around 6, 6.5 & 7. If you only play the bottom part of the keyboard or only the top part, you can make music, or if you only play the ""black"" keys it sounds good. As a toy, I like the sounds, the vibrato and being able to change the octave with a turn of a knob. It's plenty loud. I even had to turn it down a bit.

The look of thinkgeek's is version is deceptively similar to the real stylophone, so I thought that the sound was going to be just as similar. Not an unreasonable conjecture, since it would be a child's play to imitate the low density circuit of the original machine with today's technology. I was wrong. It does make a sound, yes, but not even close to the timbre I was looking for. If you ever hear David Bowie's Space song (this is ground control to major tom) it has that sound in the instrumentals. Very distinctive, vibrato triangle-wave sounding deep mechanical plastic-metal sound. Sorry, that's the best way I can use words to describe it. Listen to the song, you'll hear it. Anyway, I found out, a *real* one costs over $100 an is shipped from England. Well worth it, if you know what you want and are familiar with Rolf Harris's little gadget. If you don't care, then this is an ok way to blow $20..",299,129,Musical Instruments,4.6,,23,0.0001
2020-12-10,True,1,"He recibido la versión ""nueva"", sin alimentación por USB ni entrada de audio. A diferencia del Stylophone que le regalamos a mi hermano para su cumpleaños hace 2 meses (también comprado en Amazon, con alimentación por USB pero sin entrada de audio), la calidad de sonido del que me ha llegado es notablemente inferior, y los materiales del teclado tambien. Aún así, lo más frustrante es la imposibilidad de afinarlo correctamente. Si se afina una nota del centro del teclado (el la, por ejemplo), las graves tienden al sostenido (hasta medio tono por encima de lo que tendría que ser en algunos casos) de manera bastante aleatoria (el do es el que más, pero el re o el si también tienden aunque en menor grado) y las agudas al bemol (es imposible que el re# y el mi agudos suenen adecuadamente si el la está afinado) ¡Y esto con la octava central! La octava grave y la aguda están completamente desafinadas y sin ningún tipo de criterio, por mucho que haya variado la rueda de afinación.Por desgracia lo he tenido que devolver, no es el instrumento que compramos hace 2 meses, con un tono interesante y afinación mantenida en todo el rango. Me estoy planteando comprar el Stylophone GEN-X1, pero realmente tengo miedo que sufra los mismos fallos (claramente debidos a recortes en costes de fabricación).",299,129,Musical Instruments,4.6,,8,0.0023
2018-09-24,True,4,This is a really good styolophone and is super retro looking. There are more pros than cons to this but here are some cons:1. Doesn’t come with batteries2. Can look a little plastic-y around the silver parts3. Low batteries can make it go out of tunePros:1. Very portable2. Unique synth sound and loud as well3. Great for coming up with melodies or songs on the spot4. Very easy to handle and use5. Very cute and uniqueThis stylophone is REALLY nice and not as expensive as others. I highly recommend it as a gift for musicians or for yourself or to anyone who enjoy a synthesque portable instrument.,1256,212,Musical Instruments,4.6,,60,0.0755
2011-04-21,True,4,"For a real treat, I would plug it into a stack and let it scream with some distortion, especially if you set the pitch down really low.  Sounds like a monster, I would definitely use it live at least for some kind of effect or intro.My only gripes?  I wish the jack inputs were 1/4"" instead of RCA, but that's just personal preference.  And I have no clue why they wouldn't put the pitch wheel on top.  It's supposed to be for tuning, but it just begs for crazy glissando sweeps or quick transpositions, maybe I will modify it.Also, anyone who gives this a low review because they aren't familiar with a keyboard layout is like saying a car is bad because you can't drive stick.

I played with that thing day and night until I finally burnt up the circuits inside.  Having never seen one or even heard about them in almost 30 years, I was amazed when my girlfriend's daughter told me she wanted one for Christmas and showed me the cheap prices on Amazon.  When the Stylophone came in a week before Christmas, I had to play with it before wrapping it.  It brought back a lot of great memories; and with the new sounds and features integrated into the new product, this item is just as great or better as it was all those years ago.

2023-02-11,False,3,"I have played uke for over 50 years and own several instruments, including a vintage Gibson. I purchased this at a give-away price as a student instrument.Build: The body construction was better than expected, put together with attention to quality control. Although the advertised specs claim that high quality mahogany is used, I wouldn't  bet on it; but the finished uke looks fine. The fretboard is a plain wood, rounded on the edges. The back has a slight curvature. Matte finish. Nothing flashy - a nice design.Sound: This is a VERY lightweight uke. It is just over 17 oz. My other tenor weighs 23 oz. The Vangoa body depth is 1/2"" - 3/4"" more shallow. The wood is the thinnest possible. The end result is that tone strikes me as closer to a concert uke than the usual tenor. This is not necessarily a problem. The tone is fairly bright and the volume is sufficient.Out of the box: Many reviews mention the sharp-edged frets. I found this to be true. A few minutes polishing with a Drexel easily fixed the problem.  My uke came with one tuner that wasn't working. I fixed the problem, but it required disassembling the tuner. I expect this is unusual, as I haven't seen it reported in other reviews.Summary: Despite the Amazon ad claims, this is not a professional instrument. It will be fine to learn on, and it may be a bit better than most at this price level. Anyone who already plays and is looking to add a tenor uke to their collection should invest another $50-$100 dollars and step up to a better instrument.",37,10,Musical Instruments,4.7,,0,0.0012
2022-08-08,True,4,"Edit/clarification of review:Totally worth it, nice enough to buy a better case.Okay, soon after receiving this uke (at an amazing price BTW) I also ended up with a Kala brand uke that was very similar but much more expensive. I might actually like this one after the little modding that I had done slightly more. I cannot speak for anything over a long period of time ( only opened either for about a month, but probably at least an hour playing a day which says something ) but right now if this one didn’t have the etching around the sound hole it would be hard to differentiate between the two. I made the frets on this one really smooth and haven’t modified the other at all. So after smoothing the fret ends a little, putting slightly better tuners on it (under $20 to do & maybe 20 minutes or so) and making the body a little more smooth with very high grit sandpaper, this one feels equal to or better than one that was slightly over 4 times the original price. I upgraded the strings as well which is more a personal preference and a habit after removing for any reason which had to be done to change the tuners out, which was more preference as well as the original ones were fairly good at keeping things in tune. For reasons I cannot explain due to lack of knowledge the strings on this one also settled in and stretched out faster meaning less having to retune them for days and days. After only two or three days I no longer had to retune this anymore, even with original tuners still on it. Might be the shape or size of the bridge where they are tied around but again I really am guessing as I am not trained in luthier skills just played guitar and bass for a couple decades. That’s my update and original review follows in case you want to read what I had thought right when I got it. Still only 4 stars but to be honest if the frets weren’t so sharp and uncomfortable when I got it this would be five stars all the way. I just don’t feel things that are new should need modification or it could have the five. 4 1/2 if I could right now.In case the company is interested: I truly believe that with a nicer case and the frets done as I explained this uke could easily sell for over $100 as it is on par with ones that do. For what shouldn’t be much money invested it would really improve this, it has nice sound quality and playability already. Maybe offer it modified and without the etching around the sound hole as another model, just my humble opinion and what I would do if I were making and selling them. Overall this has a lot of potential and with the right marketing could be an awesome product. Again just the opinions of some regular guy who bought one .Original review:I’d say it’s fair for the price they are asking. I didn’t expect it to be anything amazing for what I paid. Out of the box I didn’t like it. It had rough spots on the body and really sharp frets, which I find to be common on stringed instruments until you are paying for a professional quality instrument which this is not even close to. So I had to do a little sanding on the ends of the frets. Took me maybe 20 minutes to smooth things out and polish back up with some super high grit sanding cloths. No more sharp frets. Did a little sanding on the back of the neck and body here and there to even things out to a nicer smooth finish. The machine heads kinda need replacing bad well but I’m not finding a better set easily that won’t take modifications to any real extent. But basically once I do that and maybe lower the action at the bridge a little it should be a nice little uke. Not sure how it’ll hold up long term but i mostly picked it up as something to mod and mess around with.",107,22,Musical Instruments,4.7,,9,5e-05
2020-06-10,False,4,"There are hundreds if not thousands of ukuleles on the market now, especially in the under-$100 price range. They all look good, for the most part, but there are differences, some of them serious enough to make an instruments all but unplayable. The most common I’ve come across is a misplaced bridge. Almost every under-$100 ukulele I’ve ever  tried plays increasingly out of tune as you move up the neck. Sometimes it’s just by a small amount, but I’ve had ukes  that play a full half tone or more sharp at the 12th fret. Most beginning players aren’t going much beyond the third fret, but a uke that out of tune at the 12th fret will also be noticeably out of tune at the third.This instrument, surprisingly, plays almost perfectly in tune all the way up the neck. It’s attractive, and it comes with a strap, an electronic tuner, and a spare set of strings- everything you need. It does have one annoying flaw for which I’ve taken off a star- the ends of the frets aren’t smoothed or polished, but were left rough by simply snipping then off. This isn’t a fatal flaw, and probably won’t slow down a beginner too much, but it can be an annoyance. A patient owner could take care of this with perhaps 20 minutes work- use a jewler’s file, or wrap a piece of 800 grit sandpaper around a chopstick. Still, why accept something like this when other makers get it right?",107,22,Musical Instruments,4.7,,2,0.0
2020-06-19,False,4,"So I decided to get this ukulele because I also play the guitar and thought this would be cool. I only have been playing a guitar for a few months so not real good at it yet. I had no idea that a ukulele was so much easier to learn and fun too!! I was able to quickly tune it with the included tuner and unlike my guitar it seems to hold it's tune much longer without having to retune each time I use it. Nice that it comes with a spare set of strings, some pics, strap, carry bag, and a capo. The sound quality and build quality are surprising very good considering the low cost. The only thing I really don't like is the strap. It keeps falling off while playing it and is made out of some sort of scratchy material and bothers my neck.

I opted for this one because I didn't want a cheap toy, but didn't want to spend a fortune in case she decides she doesn't like it as much as she thought she would. The reviews seemed positive across the board, and the price was right, so we went with this one. It pretty much came with everything she'd need, including extra strings. I was impressed by the quality, it looks professional and feels comfortable to hold. The carrying bag is good quality as well, which was a nice bonus. I was honestly expecting a cheap nylon uke shaped bag. This actually has some padding to it. The only thing I've noticed, which I presume is normal, is that it took about a month of playing and tuning for the strings to actually stay tuned once she started plucking away. Like I said, after about a month of playing that hasn't been a problem. Overall, I'm thrilled with this purchase, as is my daughter. I'm pretty sure she'll be sticking to it for a while.

And speaking of the tuner, be prepared to set it to the ukulele setting if you are not already familiar with the notes a uke is tuned to (long-press to turn the tuner on and then keep pressing until it says ukulele) ... and be prepared: nylon strings stretch a LOT at first, so you'll need to retune a LOT until the strings get stretched in.

2020-06-07,False,1,"I have been playing ukulele for a few years and I have seen worse instruments than this one. However, I cannot give them more than 1 star because the product description is full of lies. Not just mistakes, but outright false statements that are intended to deceive the customer.One of the big features that buyers look for when purchasing any wooden stringed instrument is what kind of wood is it made from. The product description here says: ""Quality mahogany"" and ""The solid mahogany body gives the ukulele a vivid and balanced tone."" That would be great if it was true, but looking into the soundhole, I can see that the wood is plywood and not solid mahogany. Experienced musicians should know that a solid mahogany ukulele will not cost less than $100 (and usually not less than $200 either), but someone looking for a beginner instrument will easily get fooled by the false advertising.Some other false statements: ""Low action of 2.7mm at the 12th fret"". Low action is great for beginners. The ukulele I received does not have low action. See the attached photos. According to my ruler, the string height is 3.2mm at the 12th fret and 1.2mm at the 1st fret; both numbers are high enough to make the instrument hard for a beginner to play.""The nickel silver frets are properly seated and well finished. You have no need to worry about being scratched when playing the ukulele."" The frets on the ukulele I received are not the worst I have ever seen, but the ends are still sharp enough to scratch me unless I file them down myself. I properly finished instrument would not have this problem.""Vangoa soprano ukulele features 14.32 inch scale length"". How can they make that claim? The scale length is easily measured as the normal 13.5 inches for a soprano ukulele. 14.32 inches would be an interesting design decision, but somewhere along the line, the manufacturing department did not get the memo.""Easy to Learn: Modern C shape neck"". A C-shaped neck is not easy to learn. Most people prefer a wider, flatter neck. The neck on this ukulele is only 34mm wide at the nut. A narrow neck is OK for children with thin fingers, but American adults usually prefer a 38mm neck, like many made-in-America ukuleles use. Also, the neck on this ukulele only has fret markers on the top of the fretboard, which you cannot see when you are playing. Beginners always prefer fret markers on the side of the neck, which most other brands have, even in this price range.If this ukulele had a more honest product description, I might have given it 3 stars for build quality.

2020-06-22,False,5,"WARNING- This is an in depth review of this ukulele set.  If you prefer a brief summary, see section marked THE BOTTOM LINE----------------------------------------------------------------I have a few Ukuleles.  They are nice and I do enjoy them, but for some reason, this one really hits home with me.  Let's take a look.WHAT IS THIS SET LIKE?This ukulele is a wonderful set.  Not only is the ukulele a nice size and easy to play, but the sound is great.  Let's see what all comes in this set.UKULELEThis comes with the strings all strung so you don't have to do it yourself.  You will have to tune it.  The keys are easy to turn and the strings sound pretty nice too.  The body is a nice quality and the construction seems to be good as well.  It does have  knobs on the end for the straps- more on that in a minute.REPLACEMENT STRINGSThere is a full set of nylon replacement strings in this which is a great feature.PICKSThree picks come with this.  They are on the thinner side- not rigid.STRAPThere is a lightweight cotton webbing adjustable strap for this.  I have never had one with a strap before, so it took me a while to find the 2nd knob.  When you put the ukulele up to play it., there is a knob on the end near your right hand.  The other knob is facing the FLOOR at the top of the sound chamber.  It is tricky to find at first if you are not sure where to look.  The strap slips over each knob and is quite comfortable.  If it is large enough for you, it won't interfere with your playing.CAPOI have never seen a capo for ukulele either- perhaps I am not professional enough.  HAHA  Anyway this fits the ukulele just fine. You can also use this on a guitar if you have one of those.  It works well and I had no issues with it.CASEThere is a cloth case that it comes in as well as a box.  The case has a front pocket on it for protection of the basic accessories that come with it.  Everything fits in there well.CHROMATIC TUNERThis is epic.  It has a setting for each instrument that you are trying to tune.  When you turn it to ukulele it shows you what the note of the string you are using is.  When you are at the right setting, it shows you which string this is for.  The light turns green when the sound is lined up.  It works so well.  My last tuner experience was not good.  This one is great.BOOKLETThat is where at least this has a decent booklet, but it has barely any information in it.  It does tell you how to tune the ukulele.  It tells you the basic parts of the instrument, and how to tune it.  I would have liked to see more instruction on basic songs or something, however.There is a scan code for a facebook support group.HOW DOES THIS SOUND?This sounds beautiful.  The tones are very rich yet very ukulele without sounding like a toy.  It has a really nice depth to the tone and I love playing it.WHAT DO WE HAVE TO BE SURE TO DO?GET YOURSELF A HUMIDIFIER!  I say that because a long time ago I learned that the biggest mistake people make is not putting a humidifier in with their wood stringed instruments.  After I put a humidifier in the case and let it set for a few days, it is amazing how much richer the sound and the beautiful smell of the wood that this has.You can get guitar humidifiers on Amazon here, and they are not too expensive.  Be sure to use DISTILLED water.THE BOTTOM LINEThis is a great kit for beginners and even enthusiasts like me who might have had a basic ukulele, but wanted something a little nicer sounding.  Be sure to line up some lessons online or in person and get a humidifier for this.  You will be glad you did.MY RATINGFIVE STARS.  This is my favorite ukulele yet and I love that it has a strap for those times I want to tool around the house and play at the same time.  Okay, so I am weird.  ;)",708,143,Musical Instruments,4.7,,1,0.00385
2020-06-13,False,5,"For context, I've been playing guitar since 1988 and ukulele for about 10 or 12 years. I know my way around stringed instruments.I give this uke 5 stars based on the price to value. It's a 5-star sub-$100 uke and can hold its own with many $100-200 ukes. I have Hawaiian-made ukes that are true 5-star ukes, but cost a LOT more money. I also have some I've paid for in that ~$150-250 range. I've played (in stores) dozens of different ukes in many price ranges.It's definitely made of laminated woods, which is not the least bit surprising in this price range (or even several ranges higher). There's nothing wrong with that at all and, in fact, makes maintenance a little easier (no need to use a humidifier). It looks really nice, and the pattern carved on the top is a nice touch. It's a great looking uke.I also found the tone of the uke to be surprisingly good, especially for the price. As a beginner starting out on this uke, you probably won't appreciate it, but you would certainly notice a difference if you compared it to other ukes in the price range. The tone is warm and a bit ""plucky."" It does not compare with high end ukes in this arena, but nor is that at all surprising.The workmanship isn't perfect, but it's good enough. The fret ends are typical of instruments in this range but are still perfectly useable. The hardware isn't great, but the tuners function well and keep it in tune (once you stretched and broken in the strings for a bit). The action isn't what I'd call low, but more in the medium-low range, which is fine. You could probably lower the saddle and/or file the nut slots if you knew what you were doing, but I think the action is plenty serviceable even for a beginner, especially in the first 5-8 frets or so.The set comes with a cheap electric tuner, cheap strap, cheap capo, cheap gig bag, extra strings and a some picks. They are all perfectly fine to get started with. I like that they are included in this beginner grade instrument because you won't need anything else to be able to play it, tune it, or take it with you somewhere.Besides being a good beginner or child's instrument, I'd even recommend this for someone who just wants a bang-around uke to throw in the car, take to beach, etc.If you set your expectations accordingly, you'll be very happy with this ukulele.",708,143,Musical Instruments,4.7,,0,0.0025
2020-06-17,False,5,"Great starter kit, comes with everything you need to get started. The tenor size Ukulele is a little larger than the size most people start with (soprano) and has a bit warmer tone, while still maintaining the same tuning. The build quality is nice and the tuning hardware is metal and holds a tune well. Aquila strings are included which I was not expecting at this price point and an extra set of strings is included.Along with a little beginner book, you also get some picks, a tuner, a capo, and a strap. Not all Ukuleles come with pegs for a strap it's always nice to see that, especially on the larger models. Tuner is the clip on type, works well and is already set to chromatic tuning which works fine for tuning this instrument. A case is also included. It's soft but somewhat padded and has a front pocket to store all the included accessories.If you are left handed or play that way, it is possible to reverse the strings and it still sounds fine. The top strap mount will be in the wrong location but you could still use it if needed. Overall, I'm impressed with the tone and included accessories at this price point. It may not be a professional level ukulele, but it's far from a cheap plastic toy model. A great choice for both a beginner or someone who already plays a soprano uke and wants to try a tenor without spending too much. The capo, tuner, and picks can be used on a regular acoustic or electric guitar as well. Very happy with this tenor ukulele.",708,143,Musical Instruments,4.7,,0,0.006

It's my first concert uke, and I really like the sound! It's rich and also has a bit more volume to it compared to the smaller sopranos that we have.The case isn't super high end, but it's not super cheap either. I have to admit, it took me a while looking at the symbol on the front and thinking, bass clef as a logo, that's cool, and then the name Vangoa (as in Vincent van Gogh) with a symbol of an ear (and not a bass clef). Too good to be true, but it is.The strings are good and they hold tuning well. Just remember, it can take time for the strings to adjust to your environment (humidity level, etc.). It's easy to play like the soprano-sized ukes.I really like that it comes with a shoulder strap. Really the only downside is the electronic tuner. The power button is really small and on the back.

2020-06-12,False,5,I like the VANGOA TENOR UKULELE for its pleasant sound and the kit provided for a beginner. I don’t like as part of the beginner kit there was no starter cords or beginner song examples.The Starter Kit Includes the ukulele and accessory items.  These include: Setup Guide; Chromatic Tuner; Strap; extra Strings; Pics; CAPO and a zippered fabric travel Gig Bag. There is a pocket in the bag for all the accessory items.  The Guide Book shows how to set up and hold the Ukulele but DOES NOT INCLUDE and elementary starter playing details.  Beginner on-line instructions with chord diagrams had us playing a few songs quickly.The nylon strings stretched when first adjusted.  They continued to stretch and required constant retuning for several days.  The ukulele stays in tune now. The tone is solid and pleasant.  There is no rattle and the notes ring clear. The top edge of the frets are a little rough but the bottom I found to be smooth while playing. I liked the the extra length of the Tenor size. My opinion is the kit provides good value.

2020-07-10,False,5,"This is a decent intro ukelele. Little Mister is 3 and he loves music, especially listening to the violin so I wanted to get a small string instrument he could learn on and this is the perfect size for him. It's an inexpensive option for littles just starting out so it's not a big deal when they pluck the strings hard or treat it roughly. It is a great way to get comfortable  with the instrument and begin to learn about it before moving on to a more expensive, better crafted one. This set comes with a tuner, case, strap, guide book, and a capo for a 6-string instrument. All for the current retail price of just under $50. If you're looking for a way to try it out but don't want to invest a lot just in case it turns out that junior isn't interested, then this is a very good option.",708,143,Musical Instruments,4.7,,0,0.0335

It is solidly built, fairly light weight, and feels good to the hands. The action is easy - I find that my guitar trained fingers are a bit to strong for it - I'll have to work on toning down my touch a bit.  The tone isn't bad - notes are mostly true up and down the fretboard on every string.For a beginner on the Uke, I'd say this is a pretty much perfect instrument, and it came bundled with a very workable strap, some picks, an extra set of strings and a tuner.

When you switch the foot from left to right-hand doors, be sure to check your setting against the holes already drilled. You can put pulls on 10 cabinet doors in 10 minutes, drilled and screwed up tight.For $16, it's worth the purchase if you only put pulls on 4 cabinet doors, only once in your whole life. If you can't live with a screwed up door, it's worth the purchase if it's only for one door. There are few cabinet doors for $16 or less.

I originally wanted my door handles to be 1 1/2” from the top edge but had to go with 1 13/16” instead. I think I actually prefer it this far down but measure your ideal placement to be sure it’ll work for you. I could have turned the jig to drill the top hole first and then reset it to do the bottom hole but leaves a lot of room for error.That said, I love this jig and will recommend it to everyone!

2021-08-11,True,5,"I am very happy that we purchased this jig. Drilling into brand new cabinets is nerve-wracking, but we tested this on some scrap wood and it lined things up straight. My brother-in-law gave us one of those plastic tools with preset holes and distances, but it wasn't quite centered on our cabinets, and some of our handles were not marked on it. It was also only for drawers. The adjustable nature of this made it so we could get a perfect center on both cabinet doors and drawers for any size. The tool isn't 100% necessary, but I felt better using it than making my own template.Enjoy a photo of our countertop-less existence (during a pandemic was not the best time to remodel...it took 9.5 weeks to get our cabinets and we're going on 5 weeks + 2 weeks for delivery for the countertops...things are taking FOREVER).",1100,104,Tools,4.3,,6,0.066

But in the US, must people don't have metric drill bits.  You can use a 3/16"" but it is a little loose.  I think some of the others on Amazon come with drill bits or you can opt for a better jig.

I used it on both drawers and cabinets and they look great. I did notice one pull handle is a bit crooked and that is due to the fact this thing can move on you once in place.

2022-11-20,True,4,"I needed to drill out well over 200 holes for cabinets in my new house, and was dreading the measuring until I saw this item.  I gave it a maiden run on an out of the way cabinet, and it put the holes exactly where I needed them.The hardest part is ensuring the spacing width for the handles is perfect - the markings on some of the pieces can be hard to read so you really need to measure 3-4 times to be sure it is where you want those holes to be, because once you drill, game over.Assembly was quick and once this baby is dialed in, you can just go from door to door without changing anything (assuming the doors/drawers are all same size of course).Tips:1) I was struggling with the hole spacing once I had the centerline: I ended up just putting the screws through the template drill holes and attached the handle, then moved to handle center to the center of the jig centerline and tightened.  Once you remove the screws, you just lay the template against the door and go.2) Drill a pilot hole instead of trying to drill all the way through the template.  The job will go a lot faster if you have pilot holes then go back around and drill straight through.  You can drill straight through but then you need one hand to hold the template... much easier without the template in the way.3) For opposing doors: Just flip the jig - no changes need to be made.4) If you have to cut the longer screws down, they are 8-32 and best tool I found is one of those wire strippers that have bolt cutters built into them (like $9 on amazon).A few cons: the holes in the handles could be cleaner - some screws go in easily, some are tight and I broke off three screws by trying to force them - and good luck getting the broke screws out.Get some #8 washers because it will be a thousand times easier to pop a washer behind the screw head  when a drawer/door has a tiny gap because the screw is a hair too long- trying to cut the longer screws down will drive you insane if you are just trying to take it back 1-2 threads.",278,29,Tools,4.3,,19,0.0001

This mean that I had to measure the angle carefully each time I assembled it to use.  This is because how you tighten the 2 screws will affect if it is truly 90 degrees or not.  And it's a little bit of a PITA to verify the angle.

There is a center hole that usually don’t use and one of the tabs I would suggest you just tape over that while using it and then when you readjust you can just pull that tape off.

2023-04-23,True,5,I bought this to remove a metal screw that is screwed into medal. The screw threads were seized and they designed the screw to use the weakest kind of bit possible a flat head. It stripped so easily as the screw is also made of a softer metal probably aluminum. I tried everything to try and remove it with no luck!So being a little skeptical about this removal tool as the screw I was trying to remove was on there pretty tight. But i went ahead and ordered it anyways and once it arrived went for the second to smaller bit as I can always just go up a size if I went too small. But after drilling the screw out in reverse I flipped the removal bit and used my wrench instead and I cranked the wrench and I really felt it imbedding itself into the screw then as it got a very good tight hold of the screw it became very hard to turn the wrench anymore but then to my amazment the seized screw started turning then out it came.This tool worked like a charm. But just make sure to try start with a smaller size than your screw and you can always go up a size if it didn't work.But the key to success is to drill it out till the end of the drill end starts rubbing against the screw.,166,39,Tools,3.8,,2,0.0001
2022-11-25,True,2,"I purchased a Columbia Ascender Jacket in 2016 and have worn it almost everyday for 6 years. It was finally starting to wear out in one elbow where I rested it on my desk, so I ordered the identical jacket on amazon to replace it. I was very disappointed when my new jacket arrived. Columbia has obviously started cutting corners on these jackets, here are some of my immediate observations compared to my old jacket:- The new Jacket is obviously made using a thinner material, the internal lining is not as thick or soft. This is a big deal as the jacket will not be as durable or warm.- The main zipper teeth are thinner and the zipper tends to get snagged as it zips, compared to the old jacket which had appropriately sized zipper teeth and zipped smoothly from day 1.- The breast pocket is about 1 inch shorter, no longer easily fits my wallet. I can still get my wallet in and out, but it's not like the quick draw it used to be.- The waist cinch is now only on one side, it used to be on both sides for a more even cinch.- The elastic cords on the zippers are a thinner/cheaper material and not as easy to grab.I can tell that the materials used on this jacket are much cheaper and less durable.

The pockets are strange like other people have said but the deal breaker for me was the pockets don't have the same material on the inside as out. Meaning if I am shoving my hands in jacket pockets to keep them warm, cold wind shoots into those pockets and gets to my chest. This defeats the purpose of having pockets if I can't keep my hands warm or my body from this faulty design. But the worst part is this Jacket came used without tags and someones headphones in them.

2021-05-29,True,2,"I found this jacket is decently made and meets my needs, so I did not return the item. I am, however, fairly certain this is not genuine Columbia. If it is, it would mark a substantial decline in built quality. I have had several Columbia jackets over the years and they are built to last. In fact, I still have a snowboarding jacket bought about 20 years ago that looks well used but is still serviceable without defects. I include some comparison photos between this item and genuine CSC. Most obvious is the zipper. Every other CSC jacket I have ever owned or purchased for family used high quality YKK zippers. This uses ""Ideal."" Tag style is a bit different. I don't know if CSC uses multiple countries to manufacture, but this was made in India while the one I had on hand was made in Indonesia. The tightener is also lower quality, with thinner cords and much thinner plastic parts.Now, on to functioning of this item. As some others have noted, the zipper is not smooth at bend point near the collar. Most likely it is the wrong type of zipper for so much bending. I don't zip all the way up often, so this wasn't a dealbreaker for me. Water proofing works decently well. It has the right amount of warmth to serve as light to mid jacket range, which is what I needed.Overall, I likely would have given this jacket 3-4 stars if it wasn't a counterfeit sold as the real thing.

2021-09-24,True,2,"I owned an Ascender jacket for many years and used it as a fleece layer for warmth.  And I love the fabric, which is somewhat water repellent unlike fleece.  As far as I could tell, Columbia is the only outdoor company that makes a lightweight jacket out of this material.This purchase was a replacement for the original jacket, which finally just wore out. I wish I could give this a higher rating. I took it on a recent trip to Iceland and used it every single day, since the temp there always hovered around 50 and it was rainy. The darn thing failed me, unfortunately.  This jacket zipper failed me in my hour of need. Unlike my original jacket, which had a beefy zipper with big teeth, this one had really fine teeth. The first time I zipped it up, it separated down at the bottom. Unless I was really careful when putting the zipper together, the separation happened frequently.  Once it separated, I always had a helluva time getting it unzipped again.Unless Columbia corrects the zipper issue, I would not buy this jacket again.

I narrowed my list down to this jacket and the Trailside Supply Softshell jacket (www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08CVCYPCC).  They seemed pretty similar although this Columbia jacket was $11 more expensive.  I decided to order both and then choose.These jackets are virtually identical.  Here's the differences I spotted:1. The cuff on this Trailside jacket has elastic as well as velco cuff.  The Columbia jacket just has the velcro.  The problem with only the velcro cuff is that you either strap and unstrap the velcro whenever you put it on and take it off, or you live with the cuff wide enough to get it on and off and accept it the cold air from the poor fit when you wear it.  The combination of velcro and elastic cuff on this jacket solves this problem.2. The zipper on the Columbia jacket was quite stiff.  So stiff that you need to use two hands to zip or unzip it.  The Trailside jacket has an easy smooth zipper.3. The emblem.  The Columbia jacket has their name emblazoned, whereas the Trailside emblem looks like the edge of a mountain ridge.4. The Trailside comes in a ""ziplock"" like bag.  The Columbia in a thinner resealable bag (making it awkward to get the jacket in and out past the sticky edges).5.

I am 6' 2"" and about 220 pounds, on a middle ground between wearing standard size and tall size clothes. Because of my size, fit is everything.If the Ascender could be considered the original version of this jacket, then the Ascender II is the ""slim fit"" version. Here are the differences I noticed:- The upper body of the Ascender II is much slimmer than the original Ascender. I would estimate the Ascender II to accommodate chest sizes a good 1-2 inches smaller than the Ascender can accommodate.- As others have noted, the fit between the two jackets is most noticeable in the shoulders/armpits. Arm cutouts on the original Ascender, while still trim, are much more generous than on the II. As a result, only slimmer arms will have an easy time slipping into the sleeves of the II.- Sleeves are about half an inch longer on the II as compared to the original. Sleeves on the original are also slightly wider all the way down to the wrist.- The collar is much larger on the II than the original. When popped up, the collar of the II has a very pronounced look and sticks out a good bit. When fully zipped to the top, the original Ascender provides more neck room.This is not to say the Ascender II is not a good jacket. It's just the version you'd want to get if your frame allows you to wear ""slim fit"" or ""tailored fit"" clothes.

So I wasn't surprised that when I put on the Medium that it fit well in the shoulders but was longer at the wrist and waist. I think that if I had gone with the small I would feel constricted the shoulder, but it would look more like the fit in the picture.

The shoulders fit very well, the chest has enough room. The body length is good and this is the first jacket I've had in a long time where the sleeves are sufficiently long. The sleeves also are large enough to be comfortable moving around. The mid-section doesn't fit as well. Like many tall sized clothes, the assumption seems to  be that if you're tall you must also be big. It would be nice if it came in an inch or two from the chest to just above the waist. This isn't as bad when wearing a sweatshirt or sweater, but when just wearing a t-shirt or dress shirt it is almost too big. I decided to keep it anyway because it's hard to find a tall jacket that is tall enough, and even though the mid-section is big, it doesn't look worse for it.Features: This is what you would expect from a softshell jacket. It is warm enough to work for temps just below freezing, maybe lower if you layer. It is not as wind resistant as I expected, but isn't bad. I haven't tried it in the rain yet. The pockets are large and insulated, so they will keep your hands warm.Overall it's a solid jacket.

No the less i bought a 3xlt, at my height 6'2, and around 259lb. The fit was a little more generous in length than i expected but fix generally how all Columbia fit...a little small, where is this archetype? The jacket has a medium weight, about a heavyweight champion sweatshirt in my estimate. Again Great price , just what i needed, something to run around in, take the bus(till dec, then too cold),  wear while at work, and can be used as an interior layer for a winter coat.",1591,406,Menswear,4.7,,3,0.0006
2019-12-11,True,4,"Nice looking coat, good for mild winter weather (warm for me down to 10 degree F temps so far). It's a little tighter in the chest and a little looser at the bottom than I'd like, but only slightly. Both colors I tried (Shark, Graphite) are significantly darker in person than in the pictures. I don't care for how the drawcord at the bottom is only accessible on one side because when it's adjusted the material bunches up unevenly all the way around. I super don't like the zipper; the insertion pin doesn't slide into the retainer box smoothly (just google 'anatomy of a zipper' to see what I mean), so if you're not paying close attention every time you start to zip your jacket, the teeth are gonna come apart at the bottom. I'd prefer to give 3.5 out of 5 but Amazon's rating system doesn't work like that, so I'm rounding up to four.",1591,406,Menswear,4.7,,1,0.0015
2019-06-02,True,4,"I really like this jacket. The weight is great for anything from cool spring/fall days all the way down to freezing temps. It blocks wind well and does an admirable of keeping me dry while I walk across a rainy parking lot. The classic simple style makes it easy to wear with just about anything.There are a couple of minor things that would make it even better. The sleeves are fleece-lined, which makes for a warm feel but makes it a bit more difficult to pull it off if I'm wearing long sleeves, especially if I'm wearing a sweater. The other thing I'm not crazy about is that the collar will NEVER lie flat. One side always always always sticks up. It's not unique to this jacket, nearly every soft shell I've ever owned has had this problem. I suppose it's handy if you actually zip it up all the way, but who does that?I still wear it a lot. It's my go-to jacket if it's above 25F outside.",1591,406,Menswear,4.7,,1,0.0225
2019-02-09,True,4,"Had this jacket a little over a month now and am impressed. This is the first ""soft shell"" jacket I have ever owned. It  took a little getting used to but the more I wear it the more comfortable it gets. The lining in the sleeves was a little scratchy and the feel of the jacket was rigid but the more I have worn it the lining in the sleeves has become softer and the jacket feels more broken in and is very comfortable. I couldn't see wearing it in any temp over 60 f. It definitely cuts the wind and rain.I had read previous reviews and questions in regards to sizing. Most guys with bigger frames recommended sizing up, so I did and it was the right call. For reference, I'm 6'1 325lbs, very broad shoulders and very thick chest. I'm also taller in the torso. When I buy shirts (any kind) I wear a 3xlt and it's a good fit. After reading the reviews and questions, I ordered the 4xlt. Fits absolutely perfect.",1591,406,Menswear,4.7,,2,0.0002
2015-11-20,True,4,"Positives: This is a good jacket.  I wear it for daily, casual situations when it's not cold enough to warrant a coat.  It fits well, and seems durable.  I like the look of it, and I use the chest pocket frequently.  I've worn it in 40-50F, windy conditions and it has done well.  The zippers work well.Negatives: I bought this jacket to replace a similar Patagonia jacket that got lost.  As expected, it is inferior to the Patagonia in every way I can think of, but has the virtue of being significantly less expensive.  The fleece lining makes it difficult to put the jacket on and take it off, because it sticks to my clothing.  It also doesn't breathe very well, but I'm sure that's so as not to sacrifice warmth.  The sleeves are a bit long for me, but I find that with most standard sized clothing (yes, even the Patagonia).",1591,406,Menswear,4.7,,1,0.0206
2015-12-26,True,5,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas. He's been asking for a windbreaker, and we saw this as an upgrade to just a thin windbreaker jacket. He didn't want a coat as he wants to be able to wear this in the fall as well, and layer in the winter when it gets even chillier. He's about 5'5 and very slim. This jacket is awesome, super warm on the inside and like it states in the description, has a sweatshirt feel to it. The outside feels nice and sleek, and lives up to being wind and water resistant.The fit is somewhat large on him, not width wise though. It looks like it's meant for some one tall and skinny. I bought him the smallest size but the quality of the jacket is really nice so he's willing to deal with a little bit longer than normal sleeves. The waist part is a little long too but it doesn't look bad. He also really liked that there were multiple pockets.Definitely worth, and when we bought this it was $60 - saw it in stores for $115 so felt like we got it for a steal!

That's OK since I intend to use this in the cold while snowshoeing or hiking. Wearing a hardshell just doens't breathe for those kinds of activities and regular fleece doesn't block any wind. A capilene 3 base layer shirt plus this jacket is a perfect setup.The arms are just the right length and I don't need to mess with the velcro cuffs at all. I really like the chest pocket and the collar is just right; some are way too stiff and high.My only criticism is the slight tightness around my neck. Where the zipper starts to turn up, it sort of pokes my throat. A half inch larger neck opening would be a lot more comfortable. I'll probably just not zip it up all the way.I have a size large coming just out of curiosity, but I'm betting I'll keep the medium and return the large.Update: as expected, the large was way too big in the torso.",11840,2435,Menswear,4.7,,15,0.0001

After many attempts to repair, the jacket is unwearable.Material - The material is no warmer or more water-resistant than similar jackets from other companies. Over time, I've found this jacket absorbs more water and provides less insulation/warmth.Competition - Columbia charges a premium price but two similar jackets from other companies have held up better over time, used better materials and had stronger construction...at lower prices. Most importantly you can actually wear them.Again the design and sizing are fine. The choice of materials and construction is so bad that you may want to avoid it.

But the worst part of the jacket is the zipper. My original one came with YKK zippers which are the best in the industry. You can feel the quality of them. The new version comes with zippers made by Ideal. They're awful. You can immediately tell how bad they are.

When it arrived and I tried it on, everything was great with the exception of the length of the arms.  They were way to long and my fingertips don't even stick out the ends.  So, now in order to wear it, I have to roll the sleeves way up and it looks absolutely ridiculous.  Consequently, I haven't worn it and planned to return it but just noticed that I barely missed the return window.

Overall, this is just what I wanted a jacket to walk the dog on cool days.  I wore it for errands today. 42° and rain.  Perfect. In and out of stores and the truck, never hot never cold.

I know some colors vary in price on Amazon, so keep that in mind.As for the quality, I really like it. The outer material feels very durable and of good quality. The inside is lightly lined which makes it a good jacket for Fall weather (Fall weather in California at least). If you are getting close to freezing temperatures then perhaps a different style or layering would work. I am about 5'9"" and the Medium size falls below my belt line. Not too long, not too short. The draw string on the bottom of the jacket is very helpful since I am about 30-31 at the waist. When using the draw string it doesn't give the rest of the jacket a puffed out look. The arms also have velcro straps that allow the jacket to hug the wrists better.There is no hood to this jacket so make sure you have a beanie, hat or umbrella if there is rain in the forecast. The collar can be worn up or down, depending on your style. Overall I like this jacket very much.

2020-12-15,True,5,"If you’re looking for an outer-layer jacket for cold weather multilayering, this is what you’re looking for.Bought this for my trip up to South Dakota in the winter, where as of December 2020 the temperatures are averaging 10-20 degrees. As a Louisiana native, I don’t think I’d fare very well without this thing. Wearing anywhere between 3-4 layers to keep warm.In terms of the fit, it does pretty well. I’m 5’7 at 160lbs and it does fit a little big if you wear this with just a single shirt underneath, but for multilayering this is perfect. Fits nicely above all my other layers without any constricted movement. I have shorter arms so it does come a bit over my palm, but that issue goes away with just using the velcro or having layers underneath.Works perfectly as a raincoat, but in Louisiana it does get pretty muggy and humid when it rains so I do get a little hot. This is definitely made for a colder setting, so really consider something a bit thinner if you’re looking just at the water resistance of this.The feel and look is great. I love the inside, it’s both cozy and roomy at the same time. Doesn’t choke your arms or anything with excessive inside lining. The left collar does tend to pop up every now and then when unzipped but you’ll probably want this thing zipped up anyway.Overall, this is one of the most stylish and effective coats you can’t get for the price.

2021-04-28,True,5,"I don't know how long this jacket has been sold, but they've made some changes over the years. The front chest is now deeper, wide enough for a phone. Before it was only big enough for a smaller phone, now it's big enough for anything. Or a thick wallet if you want. For those with the older models, they removed the inside pockets. It's hard to explain, but they used to use two pieces of fleece to make the pocket, meaning two layers plus the shell of the jacket created an inside pocket. By sowing a single piece of fleece to the shell, they remove material. So technically the pockets or less warm because less fleece. Not a big deal as this jacket is mostly for looks. Stitching looks cleaner throughout the entire jacket, odd reinforcements that serve no purpose are now gone, and tighter sticking in general.I'll give the Ascender 5 stars for comfort, fit, and aesthetics. But it's not really a winter jacket as it's not warm enough for 32f degrees (maybe 45f at the lowest). It's not a work jacket either because the arms are limited when trying to twist and turn. It's a comfortable, aesthetically pleasing jacket for the fall. Again, this is my second jacket, so I'm a big fan. But you must know what you are getting into.",11840,2435,Menswear,4.7,,5,0.0119

None of them have this design though so that's why they still deserve a solid 4 stars.  The elastic is the perfect thickness not to wear into your skin but not too thin.

But the legs are tight enough to grab said anatomy and be extremely uncomfortable. And it requires manual shifting of things to place them back correctly. The fabric is breathable and the fit is good otherwise, so it’s unfortunate that the design of the pouch is so problematic.

I'm 6'1"" and slim so I wear mediums but I need them to be longer so they don't ride up.

They are lightweight so they are cool and stretch enough to keep your junk in place.  The best qualities are the wicking and drying characteristics of the Bamboo viscose.  When you sweat, the underwear wick away the moisture and dry quickly.  I had a couple minor issues, but the company rectified them quickly beyond my expectations.

The legs themselves don’t but the middle does, causing a fairly consistent wedgie. I bought briefs and boxer briefs and had this problem with both. The first day I wore it, the pair rode up continuously throughout the day, getting worst as the day persisted. The briefs became a thong (a tight one at that). The boxer briefs managed to sag showing my upper butt while simultaneously tightly riding up my lower butt.

Pay attention to the sizing notes I think those are fairly accurate, but for me, I really had to pick one size that would work ""best"" In my case I was more interested in the shirt than the pants as I was partially getting it as something to add to my collection of clothing for cosplay, themed parties, and community theatre. Going by those measurements my 6ft, 230lb, broad shoulder frame and the shirt fit as expected, but the pants end up being a size or two larger than I would want or need.

Only small wrinkles remained. I did attach a photo trying to show them. From a distance, you would hardly notice them. Up close, it is a bit more obvious. Still, since this is clearly leisurewear, the fit and finish is perfectly acceptable.Pro: The pants fit perfectly. The color is nice enough.

I’m 5’11 / 185 lbs with an athletic build and XL fit good.Update:  After washing these (with cheer color guard only) the material actually got thicker and softer feeling, and the shirt is quite comfortable.  I’m wearing it right now for the first time.  The cuffs are extremely soft and luxurious feeling, and the shirt is nice and soft to the touch, more-so than expected.  It’s in the low 60’s right now in Chicago and the shirt is perfect (for me).  It’s still a rather thin material for a long sleeve shirt (thus the economical price) but it’s perfect for wearing around the house with shorts or as a layer under a jacket or warm sweater when the temps drop to the low 40’s tonight.  The material has a nice stretchiness to it, but I think it’s in the weave and not the material, which is 50/50 cotton/polyester, no mention of the common 2% Lycra.  It didn’t shrink much, if at all,  in the wash;  they advertise that it’s preshrunk and I’d agree, and the length, both shirt and sleeve, for XL is plentiful for me at 5’11”.  Often the arms shrink and end up a little short on me unless I go up a size, so this is a nice surprise.  Jerzees didn’t skimp on the amount of, albeit thin, material.

When you looked at this did you note the banded cuffs?  These are fairly small and the diameter of the sleeves below the elbow is fairly small as well.  I live in the South where it rarely gets very cold.  It is important to be able to adjust warmth as the day progresses by shedding layers and or rolling up sleeves.  That is the major problem with this shirt.  It is difficult to push the sleeves up and expose forearms.  I did grab the cuff and the lower sleeve and pull until it stretched out a bit.

The stones are sparkly and the settings for the stones are open-back, giving them a more delicate appearance.The different little dangling sections are set off with separate ring connectors so that they hang nicely on the neck and ears--a sign of quality, as lesser sets would be a single fused piece.While the earrings are way too dressy for everyday, I can see wearing the necklace separately with more casual clothes.I'm delighted with this set and think you will be too.

2022-03-19,True,3,"The Samsung A8 is near bottom of the Samsung line up of tablets.  It comes in two memory sizes, 3gb and 4gb versions starting at 64gb of storage.  Let me start by saying, there is no reason whatsoever to buy the 32gb variant as it comes with only 3gb of physical ram.  That extra gig of ram is what makes this tablet worth the money.  I only recommend the 4gb variant, and find the 64gb storage model is really the sweet spot with this tablet.  So let's get into the review.The first thing I noticed is the weight.  It is a heavy tablet.  This is not a deterrent to me as I do most of my gaming using an Xbox controller (bluetooth) so I am not holding onto the tablet for long periods of time.  This is good because the weight of it becomes cumbersome very quickly.  The 10.5"" screen is good, not great, but good.  The tablet resolution, while not fantastic does allow HD playback on netflix.  This is a nice touch.  There is however, a one inch bezel round the screen.  This makes the tablet look dated, as the era of large bezels is well beyond us.  The only good thing about such large bezels is it gives the user a place to put their fingers when holding onto the tablet.  The screen is quite bright, although the glossy surface does make use in bright environments difficult.  My biggest issue with the screen is that it does not brighten or darken well when there is a change of lighting environment.  This is a feature we have become used to, so it feels like a real miss in terms of ease of use.There are four speakers on this tablet on top and bottom (portrait mode) and they get quite loud.  Don't expect audiophile quality here, but they do the trick, and were able to create a wide soundstage when watching a movie.  I would recommend the use of a quality earphone solution.  I use QE2 monitor headphones and the sound was much better.  There is no EQ baked into the OS, which is a letdown.There are few buttons on the side, a volume rocker, power switch and an earphone jack as well as USB C charging.  It does support Bluetooth, which is good.  I was able to have music playing on the tablet, and wash dishes in the kitchen while the tablet remained in the living room without any loss in signal.  I also used it at the laundromat, with the tablet in a backpack, and was able to stay connected.  One thing that is missing with the Bluetooth is hearing aid compatibility.  While I can download the hearing aid app, connecting my aids to the tablet is another thing.  Most hearing aid connections are established through the accessibility options in settings, however, Samsung chose not to include any hearing aid connections in their accessibility options.  This is a huge miss.  Those of us who are reliant upon hearing aids will find their experience reduced as a result.  Considering this connection is just a software fix, not having it is a huge middle finger to the deaf community.  Shame on you Samsung.  The battery life is okay, but when connected to a 30 watt charger, it did recharge quite quickly.  Unfortunately it comes with a very low wattage wall wart, so I recommend buying a higher wattage charger.This comes with Android 11.  I installed a few apps such as the Kindle app which surprisingly works much better as an app then the native program on the Kindle HD 10.  I also installed a few games, Asphalt 9, Castle Wreck, Bubble shooter and Klondike Forever and lastly the You Version Bible app. None of those apps besides  the kindle were available in the Kindle app store.  All the apps worked well enough, although Castle Wreck did cause the tablet to slow down due to the amount of rendering involved in that game, and the low amount of physical ram.So why should you buy this tablet?  If you don't want to pay for a pad from another fruity company, but want more than can be had from the Kindle HD 10 this is for you.  That is really the best comparison to The Samsung A8.  Provided you purchase a 4gb model, it functions much better than the HD 10, the biggest advantage is native access to the Google Play Store, and a full fat version of Android 11.  Don't expect a feature rich tablet like the S line of Samsung, but if you are interested in light web browsing, casual gaming and reading, as well as streaming media playback, this tablet will work well.So in the end, this tablet is a good enough introduction to the tablet market.  With the affordable price, it is a good tablet for children, classrooms with a good screen protector and case, or for that family member who could use a tablet, but would not have the use of a more expensive unit.  I started this review by recommending only the 4gb models, (64/128 storage).  Believe me, you will notice a difference.  4gb of ram is quite low by today's standards, and you will notice that in the performance.  Web pages refresh a little to quickly, and after a day of use, the tablet will become noticeably slower, requiring a reboot.  This can be mitigated a bit by fully shutting off programs, (swiping up, and swiping away open programs) as well as limiting notifications.  As of now, there is no indication that Samsung intends to update this tablet to Android 12, but perhaps there will be a work around.  Be careful, as the A8 is very low in specifications, and forcing a newer OS unintended for the product might cause it to age quicker then designed.Overall the A8 does meet my needs, and while not wonderful in any way, it gets the job done under $400, which is a plus.",757,200,Laptops and Tablets,4.5,,585,0.0001
2022-08-23,True,3,"I bought the 32 GB internal storage and 3 GB RAM version, which is the cheapest model due to it being on sale. If this will be your go-to, main tablet then I would suggest upgrading to a version with more RAM and internal storage. Others say the 64 GB internal storage doesn't experience any studder performance with the device.  This 32 GB internal storage (3 GB RAM) studders through swipes and many other operations. I am still going to keep it though, because I only have a few purpose for this device.  Sufficient to use for reading books, but just make sure it's not under the bright sun. It allows me to watch YouTube TV, YouTube, Netflix, HBO Max, just fine, but I tell you I come from owning an old IPAD Air that does not even qualify for the latest IOS update today.  That IPAD is just as smooth if not smoother than this tablet, however due to the IOS (12.x) being outdated, it cannot run many applications. This Samsung SM-x200 A8 tablet can run all the applications that I want to use today. Here are the PROs and CONs from my perspective:PRO:- Newer device that runs most application today that I use.- External MicroSD card feature.- Cheap price, waaaaay cheaper than Apple Ipads.CON:- Studders with 32 GB internal storage and 3 GB RAM.- Screen brightness not that bright, but useable. Glossy screen reflects under the sun so probably not that great outdoors.Summary - Battery life is OK, I think it isn't that impressive but up to 8 hours+ of usage is not terrible. Upgrade to the higher internal storage/memory model versions to avoid studdering I guess, other reviewers say the tablet is better with more internal storage.  I believe with higher amount of internal storage, Samsung also increases the RAM to 4 GB RAM, but I'd double check before you buy on that information. The software applications installs on the internal storage, and I have not been able to figure out if they can be installed on the external MicroSD card.  On the other hand, you CAN move the data many or most of the ""data"" that the installed applications use to the external MicroSD card. Speakers are loud and clear, really like it. The WIFI connection is okay, but I bet overall tablet performance would be WAY better if there was slightly more RAM internally (3 GB vs 4 GB). This tablet supposedly is compatible with up to 1 TB of external MicroSD storage, and I have one on order that's arriving soon.  If is not compatible with the 1 TB MicroSD card, I will update my review and mention it, but I do not anticipate any problems.I do not use this tablet as my main source of electronic device though (I prefer my higher performance laptop), so this is why I will keep it even though I think the performance for this lower-tier performance device is a bit lacking. It works very well for watching streaming services, reading books and minor browsing. If you are okay with the studdering performance here and there, then this is an inexpensive product to have on a budget. It connects to my home network NAS just fine, I can plug in the USB-C power cord and let it stream news all day, no issues (for now). I'm sure after a few years this tablet will be obsolete just like my Ipad Air has become, but it will have served its purpose.",757,200,Laptops and Tablets,4.5,,40,0.0001

2023-02-18,True,3,"I bought this device for my Neice to use to occupy her child when she has things to do. This device did not survive a toddlers use very long because, of touch screen design flaws.I prefer using a mouse and a keyboard with my PC and a basic standard mobile phone with a push button keypad and scroll buttons for the LED settings menu (if I could find one) rather than using touch screen devices because, when the touch screen is deactivated by constant swiping and or the decoupling of screen protectors, the devices touch feature cannot be readily repaired. When using a mouse or keyboard that wear out, you can replace them however when touch screen stops working, your only alternatives are to take it to a technician to repair it or you are forced to replace the entire device. Push button mobile phones are more reliable and not as easily damaged as these overly delicate so-called smart devices are. The push-button age should not be abandoned in favor of a touch screen age.  Tech companies need to abandon this touch screen technology altogether because it is not senior and toddler friendly. When vision and manual dexterity issues develop, touch screen devices are too difficult for a visually impaired 70-year-old stroke victim like me to use.  I would not recommend this overly delicate device for seniors, heavy-handed persons, or children under the age of three. Update: letting the battery power run down to 0% and then recharging the battery restored the tablet to full function. It seems that the device had locked out all touchscreen functions arbitrarily due to repetitive pin number entry requests that my niece's child had access to during regular use. The touchscreen restart and power off icons were locked out along with all other functions. Power off and restart should not be touchscreen activated only. There should be two small push buttons on the side of the device to facilitate a manual restart and power off in all new versions of this device so that users don't have to wait for the battery to die to restart the tablet. Touchscreen technology is too unreliable to use because of excessive security protocols and without access to these push button restoration features. Samsung and Apple designers should incorporate these features so that when touchscreen fails to work, you can rely on these push button restart and power off functions to reset it.",757,200,Laptops and Tablets,4.5,,1,0.0005
2023-05-03,True,3,"First off the battery takes a long time to charge. At times it won't charge at all. I watched it run down from 88% to 21% in 45 minutes. Dont know why.I got this for more memory. 128G was plenty to run my Ultimate Golf game without fear of using up all the storage. Although it did update to Android 13 the over sensitive touch screen causes the game shot meter to move excessively causing off target shots no matter how still I hold my finger. The lag going from scene to scene is excessive and makes the game unplayable. Not so on the Tab A7. No way to adjust it either. This processor is also noticeably slower than the A7. Different manufacturers. The A7 is a Qualcomm, the A8 is not.Secondly this A8 has slower upload speed than the A7.The hypersensitive screen is really annoying especially when gaming.The camera is poor. Low quality and somewhat foggy images along with poor video recording makes this A8 not desired for imaging.Watching a Netflix movie is good, clear and very HD but that's why I have a TV.For the money I expected more.",757,200,Laptops and Tablets,4.5,,2,0.0003
2022-02-23,True,3,"First off, it's a good tablet and I can recommend it. With some caveats.It's suitable for watching videos if you can find a streaming source with good quality sound. It's good for reading, clear and the right size screen. With wifi you should be able to skype or zoom just fine, but be aware of the camera set up. The screen size is great without becoming unmanageable. Much larger would be too much, but 10.1"" is what I had before and that worked for me as well.The camera for the front (facing the same way the screen is) has been set on the lengthwise edge. So if you'r going to set this up for video chats, you will need to keep the long side up.The usb port is USB Type C, which is a different plug than what you may be used to if you've been using a Type Micro-B (very common on cell phones and desk tops now.) Be careful you are getting the cabling you anticipate. Also the cable for charging is very short. Don't expect to both charge and use the tablet at the same time much.Important to note, if you're expecting to add a micro-SD card to increase storage, you will find there is no slot for that. Should that be your intent, look at another tablet. As it happens, 128G is more than adequate for my needs, I suspect 64G would be pushing my luck. I've been using a tablet with 16G internal storage and a micro-SD flash drive but found there are a lot of things Android will not let you store off to the flash drive. The large internal storage will alleviate that issue for me, but consider if this is what YOU want.I struggled doing the transfer between my old tablet and the new one, but this turned out to be because the new one needed to update the data moving tool a few times to match what I downloaded to my old tablet. Go figure. Once connected it went smoothly.",757,200,Laptops and Tablets,4.5,,291,0.0001
2022-09-09,True,3,"I like the size of the A8. I like the brightness, I usually hardly ever have to turn up the brightness beyond about 15% of maximum!I don’t like the slow processor it it. There are lots of slow app loadings, stutters.  The colors are muted and just ‘off”.  The boot times are abysmal. Takes forever and a day.  Also, upgrading apps takes a huge amount of time, crazy long compared to an iPhone 7 Plus (2016) or Samsung A53 (2022). The Unisoc chip is a joke, especially with what Samsung is charging for this device.  I will not be buying another Samsung tablet.They, and it is Samsung, keep you from off loading your apps onto a microSD card. Android lets you, it’s Samsung that neuters this functionality. The reason they give is that it would degrade performance. This might have been true in 2005, but not in 2022. MicroSD card read write speeds are hugely improved. And with A1 or A2 certified cards, random read/write speeds are extremely fast. And the Unisoc chip is the bottleneck, not the storage here. So, if you want one of these, get one on a deep discount, if at all.  And if you get one thinking that you can put apps on your card, think again!  Oh, 32GB models?  Really Samsung?  After the OS and a few additional programs there isn’t much left for storage.  NO ONE in the year 2022 should be putting any computing device out there with anything less than 128GB of onboard storage.  Oh, and why are we still waiting for Android 12 in September of 2022?!  Really?  Android 12 was already out when this device was released!Next time, I will save my money and buy an iPad.  It’s updated faster, has more, better apps, that are better vetted.  Or I’ll save a lot of money and buy a cheap Lenovo or something. They at least will let me offload apps to microSD.

I had to recharge half way thru the day. My Lenovo stayed charged much much longer than this Samsung Galaxy. I had to return this one because the keyboard must have been corrupt.

The latest security update is June 1, 2023.I am waiting on the Tab A9.  So far, no definite word on whether there will be one.  It  will be a shame if there isn't one because the Tab A8 once updated is a nice little tablet and meets my tablet needs.  Not much power but I only use it for reading.  I have a half a dozen or so reading apps besides the Kindle app and all are updated regularly.I would be disappointed if there is no Tab 9 because I dislike using Android tablets are not getting Android version updates or security updates.

Also, Samsung keeps the TabA7 up to date on Android Security patchesThe TabA8 works fine that is why I am not giving it a one star rating  It is also very slow to charge.  A lot slower than the TabA7.I can not recommend the SM-X200 model of the TabA8 at all.  Maybe if you are in a different location this model of the TabA8 will update.Updated 3/22/22 See bottom of reviewNot reviewed for typos.I ordered a 4 x 64 version.  The box said 4 x 64.  The actual device as a 3 x 32.  I contacted Amazon about the problem and they sent the correct replaement immediately and I received the replacement on the same date that i was scheduled to receive the originalNow about the Tab A8.  I had previously purchased a Tab A7 3 x 64 from Amazon.  You should be able to find my review of it on Amazon.  This review is bascially a comparison of the A8 with the A7.First off.  I recommend against buying the A8, 3 x 32  It wasn't unitl I had used Switch to copy over my apps and data from the A7 to the original A8 that I received that I discovered they had sent me a 3 x 32 intead of a 4 x 64.  If you order the 64GB version of the A8 it automatically comes with 4GB RAM.In any case the transfer of the apps and data from the A7 3 x 64 to the A8 3 x 32 took close to two hours using Samsung Switch.  Transferring the data from the A7 to the A8, 4 x 64 took less than 15 minutes.  There is no doubt that the extra 1GB  RAM and 32GB of memory makes a big difference.  The Tab A7 with 64GB is a very nice tablet but compared to the Tab A8 with 64GB the Tab 8A is signficantly faster.  I opened multiple apps and switched between them without any lag.As I have posted before I am no gamer so I can't comment of the gaming capabilities of either tablet but when it comes to everything else including downloading and installing updates the Tab A8 64GB is noticeably faster than the Tab A7 64GBThe display comparison is bit more complicated.  The sharpness of the display is better on the A7 but the Tab A8 display at 10.5"" vs 10.4"" of the Tab A7 is more boxy and looks more like a desktop display than a tablet display.  I put up a video on the Tab A8 and a 23"" Samsung desktop display monitor.  While some of the picture is lost on the Tab A8 it isn't a lot compared to the Tab A7 which crops off a good deal of the top and bottom.For some reason, the Tab A7 has a better; i.e., signficantly louder audio than the Tab A8 both running on Android 11 with Samsung UI 3.1.  The Tab A8 audio is good for watching videos etc but the Tab A7 can give you room type audio when you are listening to music.  I can't judge the distortion but in any case while the Tab 8A audio is fine the Tab A7 audio is better.While neither the Tab A7 or A8 batteries will charge very fast I haven't noticed much diffenece between the two with the Tab A8 charging a bit faster using the Samsung charging block and cable that came with the Tab A8.  No comment on battery draing speed as that will always vary based upon usage.  I ams satisfied with the battery drain speed on both the Tab A7 and Tab A8,  Then again I don't play games.Final comment.  The Tab A8 is year newer so it came with Android 11 vs Android 10 for Tab A7.  So it should get one more Android update and Samsung related UI update down the road.  Both are nice tablets but the extra GB of RAM along with a different CPU makes the Tab A8 a lot more enjoyable to use.Update 3/22/22Heptics -  The heptics on the Tab A8 are super sensitive which makes for very light touches.  On the Tab A7 the heptics are not nearly as sensitive.Startup -  With the Tab A8 there is very little impact on usage immediately upon startup after logging in.  Upon login you should be able to alsmost immediately begin doing whatever.  On the Tab A7 you have to wait for software like anti-malware to do their thing after login before you can do much of anything.  The wait time will vary depending on your software.For that reason I don't turn off the Tab A7 except when I know I won't be using it for an extended period, like a day or more.  I think the extra GB of RAM in the Tab A8 makes the difference since both my Tab A8 and Tab A7 are loaded with identical software including Android 11 and Samsung 3.1 UI.Battery - Samsung UI 3.1 does a good job of saving battery after it learns which takes a few days.  Therefore, leaving the Tab A8 or Tab A7 on does not drain much battery once the devices are optimized by the Samsung software as long as you turn off the display when the devices are not in use.  I also recommend turning off the display for playing music, streaming or otherwise if you want to save on battery drain.In order to assure continuous playing of music when the display is off you have go to the music playing app and turn on allow in battery saving mode.",300,173,Laptops and Tablets,4.5,,203,0.0003

(Has other problems too but the battery life takes the cake) I will charge this tablet all night get it to 100% and within an hour of using it I’m getting a low battery alert. I have to plug this tablet in MULTIPLE times a day to stop it from dying. It basically lives plugged in which is annoying in at self because it came with the world shortest charger cord. When it dies and you plug it in it won’t automatically turn back on you have to wait for it to get to a certain battery percentage than you can manually turn it back on which takes another 10 minutes to load and do.

It arrived on 7/13 and I spent a day getting it all set up, and it worked great for 2 days. Then yesterday, I'm watching a movie on it and the screen freezes, but the audio was still going. I could do absolutely nothing on this tablet. No menu options would come up. Even the power button would do nothing. After about 15 minutes I managed to turn it off and back on. I went back to my movie, and a few minutes in, I paused it for a few seconds. When I went to unpause, the audio started going again but the screen was frozen. The same thing as before the screen wouldn't do anything and neither would the power button, for about 20 minutes.I'm going to try a hard reset and set it back up, but if it does this again, I'm returning it.",300,173,Laptops and Tablets,4.5,,1,0.0042
2023-01-03,True,2,"I made sure to read up and watch as many reviews for this tablet before I made the purchase decision, many stating how it was a great performing tablet for a budget price. The first couple days of using it myself had proven to be about on par as to what those reviews said. Then quickly the issues began piling on.Constant app crashing, frame drops on the home screen after waking it up after a whole night, input delays and lots of setting features I couldn't find that are accessible on most other android devices.One of the biggest gripes I had that I just could not find a fix to was it's nature to just randomly kill off any bluetooth devices connected to it. It would refuse to reconnect anything until I either waited an indefinite amount of time or restarted the entire tablet. But it would just kill the bluetooth again when it felt like throwing a tantrum, and Samsung forums were not very helpful, especially when most of the solutions involved going into settings menus that don't exist on this tablet.It has a bit of a chug starting up most games but would handle decently during gameplay for the most part. Though a lot of 3D games ended up putting a struggle on the frames even on low settings.The cameras are fine and work well for video calling and any spur of the moment photo taking you may have and from what I've been told by people I called, the mic isn't half bad.Battery life is surprisingly good and lasts me at least a few days.However, I my plans to use this tablet for internet scrolling, light gaming and messaging just cannot be done on a consistent level with the unpredictable bluetooth disconnections, constant lag and overall performance issues. I can't personally recommend this tablet to anyone looking for a budget tablet.",300,173,Laptops and Tablets,4.5,,0,0.0
2023-06-29,True,2,This tablet works just fine the only knock I have with it is it has no cellular data and CAN NOT be added to your cell phone plan for internet connection. You must buy a battery operated gizmo from your pervider to get a internet connection. And yes they charge you a monthly fee to use it on top of the purchase price.I feel that this is a important detail that should have been included in the product information.So if you were planning on using this tablet for moble internet and adding it to your phone plan look at a different product that has celluler data.,300,173,Laptops and Tablets,4.5,,1,0.0006
2022-05-18,True,2,"The Tab A8 gave me a strong first impression. Its exterior, thickness and weight, along with the very slim bezels, made it feel like a premium device. The size of the screen is great for watching movies, and its Dolby Atmos support got me excited. Buttons felt solid, too, with the right amount of click.Upon booting and setting it up, the UI felt smooth... most of the time. There was occasional slowdown when flipping through screens. The pixels making up the app icons were very noticeable, and sometimes text in YouTube and Disney+ looked pixelated.I did not intend the Tab A8 to be a gaming or working device. I just wanted to buy and download movies to watch offline. Seemingly a simple thing for a 2022 device to do without issues. For some reason, Disney+ would crash often, and struggle to play any shows. Downloading movies was a chore (yes, I set them to download to the SD card) and after all was done, they wouldn't play. Oh well, I could still get movies on YouTube NOPE. Movies would download, but would not load when going offline.All of this, on top of performance gradually becoming slower. Even after uninstalling most apps and leaving only the streaming ones, apps would often crash. Rebooting only mitigated the issue for a bit.Why do manufacturers think that 2-3GB of RAM are good enough for modern devices? The OS alone, freshly booted with no apps opened, ate up 2.1 of the 2.6GB of available memory. I just wanted to watch movies. Yes, I know there's a version of the A8 with 4GB of RAM. My point being, the 3GB version should not exist.It really was a heartbreaking experience.

When they returned it, the yellowish tint is gone... now everything is just slightly blue.  Holding the old tablet next to the new one shows a significant color difference. Would I get used to it? Maybe. Would I be happy with it? No. I'm back to using my old one. I should have returned this one immediately rather than try to get used to it.

2022-04-14,True,2,"I had high hopes for this tablet, switching from a Kindle Fire which wouldn't run some apps I wanted. However, after a few months I've decided I'm disappointed. First, I just recently tried to pair two different sets and brands of bluetooth earbuds. In both cases I experienced the same issue: sound only came through one earbud and somewhat erratically, not always the same side. The earbuds work fine when paired with other devices (like my old Fire or a laptop), so it's not the earbuds. In any case I tried all the troubleshooting, repairing, etc. recommended for the earbuds. So there is something off in the bluetooth audio function in the tablet. Secondly, I regularly get a reading of less than 100% charge (something in the 90s) after many hours of charging. Checking on this issue, I did a complete battery drain to ""reset"" the meter, but after a couple charges it went back to not reaching 100% again. I also miss from the Fire a simple bluescreen filter toggle for reading before bed. The Samsung has a night brightness reduction but with set times which can't even be changed. There don't seem to be a lot of quality tablet options in this price range, so I'm really sad this hasn't worked out so well. The Fire did better in all the areas mentioned here for far less money. I would buy a new Fire if its Android implementation wasn't hamstrung. So I guess I'm stuck.",300,173,Laptops and Tablets,4.5,,1,0.0002
2023-07-05,True,1,"My experience with the SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab A8 10.5"" 32GB Android Tablet has been deeply disappointing. From the slow charging and inadequate battery life to the frustrating lag and unresponsiveness, this tablet has failed to meet even the most basic expectations. Regrettably, I cannot recommend this device based on my personal experience.One of the major drawbacks I encountered with this tablet is the painfully slow charging time coupled with a disappointingly short battery life. It becomes an inconvenience to have to wait extended periods for the tablet to charge, only to have it drain quickly during usage. This aspect significantly hampers the tablet's usability and overall practicality.Furthermore, the tablet's performance is severely hindered by excessive lag and unresponsiveness. The delayed response time between tapping the screen and the tablet's reaction is frustratingly noticeable, making even simple tasks a laborious process. The sluggish performance greatly impacts the overall user experience, detracting from the tablet's potential functionality.Additionally, the tablet's performance continues to disappoint even during media consumption. In my case, after downloading a movie from Netflix to watch online, the tablet struggled to play the content smoothly. It frequently experienced lag and would pause every 30 seconds for approximately 5 seconds, significantly disrupting the viewing experience. Such performance issues undermine the tablet's ability to deliver enjoyable and uninterrupted media playback.Considering my experience, it is difficult to ascertain whether I received a faulty unit or if this is a widespread performance issue with this particular tablet model. Regardless, I cannot recommend the SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab A8 10.5"" 32GB Android Tablet to anyone based on my personal experience.Pros:None mentionedCons:Slow charging time and inadequate battery lifeFrustratingly laggy and unresponsive performanceSignificant delay between screen taps and tablet responsePoor performance during media playback, with frequent lag and pausesIn conclusion, my experience with the SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab A8 10.5"" 32GB Android Tablet has been deeply unsatisfactory. The slow charging, short battery life, severe lag, and unresponsiveness make it an unusable and frustrating device. I would strongly advise considering alternative tablet options that offer better performance and reliability.Wishing you better luck in finding a tablet that meets your needs and expectations.",697,393,Laptops and Tablets,4.5,,15,0.9999
2023-02-05,True,1,"This is an ok product--the screen is big and very clear, which is nice, but the battery doesn't last very long. (my main use is using it with a songbook type of app for practicing music) I dont run games, or stream anything on it, and the battery only lasted about 4.5 hours. SEE EDIT BELOW AFTER HAVING IT FOR A FEW MONTHSSpeaking of the battery--it also takes a whale's age for it to charge up again. Like HOURS long to charge it.

The tablet was subsequently FACTORY reset and returned to AMAZON.  Unfortunately, I, the new owner, cannot setup and use the used tablet without having the prior owner's Google logon ID and password.  I get this error message:  """"This device was reset.  To continue, sign in with a Google Account that was previously synced on this device.""  Since I do not have and cannot get the previous Google Account information, I cannot use the tablet.

Samsung suggested I send the tablet in to them for service.  Although I have not checked, I can imagine this will be costly with shipping and $$ for the service, not to mention the weeks of turn-around from Samsung.  Also, I have spent hours on the Internet and YouTube looking for a way to crack the previous Google Account with no luck.

I'll call back to get a refund, but this is definitely not a deal if I have to send it back and spend more money elsewhere for a tablet to go with the SD card and case that I also bought through Amazon on Prime Day.

2023-05-31,True,1,"I've had this tablet for around seven months now, and I can state unequivocally that this device has the absolute worst internet access of any device I've ever owned.  My wife is the primary user of the device, and nearly every day she complains about not being able to connect to the internet while every other device works fine.  When it does connect, web browsing is incredibly slow!  It's nearly unusable for watching videos (YouTube or other video services).  I've owned some really low-quality devices, and they could all handle watching a YouTube video without buffering every couple of minutes...not this device!  The tablet has been relegated to a for-reading device only at this point.  If you are considering this device, I'd buy it with the return trip planned in advance because you are unlikely to like the device.",697,393,Laptops and Tablets,4.5,,4,0.0157

My mother went through the process of trying to set it up and we had to choose a language and country. The USA wasn't even an option. I figured that had to be some kind of weird glitch, so I called customer service. Come to find out I was sold a tablet that isn't even U.S. compatible. I felt awful for my mom and totally duped by Amazon that I had to send my gift back. The customer service rep asked me did I want to give them ""another chance"" by sending a replacement. This was after she told me that there were complaints about misleading information with this product.

2022-09-13,True,1,"Got this to replace my 6 year old Kindle Fire only to discover rather quickly that you must be in direct line of sight of your wifi router to get any reception at all. Any door or wall will drop the signal so low you can't stream anything and will eventually just disconnect itself despite being only a few feet from the router. Total garbage. My phone and all other wifi devices have excellent signal anywhere in the house, even outside. Not this trash though.How does this have such good reviews when my very much older device is 100 times better at the only thing that matters?Total waste of money.*UPDATE*After about 7 months of use I would like to update my original review by asking Amazon for something lower than 1 star. Zero stars? Negative stars?In addition to the abysmal wi-fi reception, it also seems that the battery life of this thing is also unacceptably horrible. In a turned off state the unit will lose about 25% battery life per day. That's right, TURNED OFF it loses battery life at an amazing rate. You would have to keep it permanently connected to power to be able to use it daily. I find myself using it less and less. So If I go a week without  using it I have to do a complete full charge to use it again (this takes several hours) so it's never ready when I need it.",697,393,Laptops and Tablets,4.5,,2,0.0002

At first I thought I must be touching the navigation buttons but I was able to rule that out because the problem occurred even when the tablet was laying flat on the table with nothing even close to the navigation buttons. I couldn't even set up my email initially it happened so often. I contacted Amazon customer support, and they had me try all the things I had already tried to no avail. But at least it began to happen less frequently. I should have returned it the first day, but the problem became more intermittent. It still happened multiple times every single time I used it, but less often so I was able to complete tasks. Nobody wants to return a device they've put all their personal information on, so I continued to be patient. One month in, and I took it off the charger one morning, checked the weather without issues, and 5 minutes later it was just a brick. Completely unresponsive. I tried a factory reset from the off position without luck. Ruled out charger issues. Thankfully Amazon refunded my money and took it back. I am sure every tablet isn't as defective as the one I was sent, but that is the one I am reviewing.

I usually had earbuds for sound as I used it primarily as a bedtime device and I did not want to disturb my wife. After about a month of ownership, I turned on the tablet to find that Android 12 had to be installed to further use the product. After installation of Android 12, the tablet developed a strange problem. When I turned it on after off for the night, there was no sound. I restarted the tablet and was relieved to find the sound returned. Each time off for the night, next day no sound. It always required a time consuming restart. I finally contacted Samsung support. After two techs and a lot of time to try and resolve the problem, NO improvement. By this time I had spent at least six hours wasted with NO improvement. Finally Samsung said to mail it to New Jersey for repair. Today they emailed me my tablet is to be returned unrepaired. The Samsung representative claims the tablet had been damaged by water which voids the warranty. TOTAL BS.

2023-07-28,True,5,"From the moment I laid hands on the SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab A8 10.5” Android Tablet, I felt a wave of excitement surge through me. I had just traded up from my week-old tablet, shattered by a small accident, and immediately, the potential of the Galaxy Tab A8 seemed limitless. Here, I've curated a comprehensive review of this device, drawn from my personal experience and bolstered by user feedback to deliver a true journalistic, fact-based, and SEO-friendly perspective.Firstly, I was smitten by the robust and seamless connectivity the Galaxy Tab A8 offered with my Samsung cellphone, including its cellular data. This feature transformed my disappointment about the lack of cellular connectivity in the tablet into a sense of satisfaction. It gave me the freedom to talk, text, browse the web and much more.The Galaxy Tab A8 provided ample storage with its 32GB internal capacity, which I expanded by adding a 128GB micro SD card. That, coupled with the seamless sync with my wireless keyboard and mouse, made the user experience more enjoyable. A noteworthy mention is the battery life - it lasts an entire day on a single charge, a feature that earned it some brownie points.One aspect I found quite challenging was setting up a child profile and restricting access to apps. However, after crossing that initial hurdle, the journey has been fairly smooth. My nephew, for whom I had bought the device to replace his fire tablet, enjoys gaming on it. The superior image quality, fantastic battery life, and impressive sound quality, despite the slight issue with the game field not expanding in landscape mode, make it a formidable gaming tablet.The Galaxy Tab A8 makes transferring data from previous devices effortless. It's a great pick for showcasing product slideshows at my craft shows, proving its utility as a reliable business partner. The tablet, with its stunning 10.5"" LCD screen, Snapdragon 450 processor, 3GB RAM, Dolby Atmos surround sound technology, and Kids Mode, makes it an entertainment hub for all ages.However, despite its many positives, the Galaxy Tab A8 is not without its flaws. It's slightly on the heavier side, making it a bit cumbersome to hold for longer durations. Additionally, the device's lack of automatic brightness adjustment is a minor inconvenience.Pros:+ Seamless connectivity with Samsung cellphones.+ Ample storage capacity, expandable with a micro SD card.+ Excellent battery life.+ Immersive gaming experience.+ Easy data transfer from previous devices.+ Great for business presentations.+ Superior entertainment features with a stunning display and immersive sound.Cons:- Lacks cellular connectivity.- Challenging to set up child profiles and app restrictions.- Heavy to hold for prolonged periods.- Does not automatically adjust screen brightness.In conclusion, the SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab A8 10.5” Android Tablet is a high-performance device that strikes a commendable balance between work and play. It has some areas for improvement, but overall, it delivers value for its price, making it a worthy purchase for individuals or families alike. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone seeking a blend of performance and affordability in their next tablet.",13381,1166,Laptops and Tablets,4.5,,12,0.9999
2023-07-03,True,5,"I purchased this tablet since, my tablet I had just purchased a week ago getting dropped and the screen shattering. My previous tab was only 1 week old, but since it was going to cost about the same price to fix than I bought it for it wasn't worth it. So, I decided to 'upgrade' when I saw this Samsung. I honestly thought this tab had wifi and cellular, but I found out that wasn't the case 😔 and was pretty disappointed. I was planning to return it until I realized that it syncs up to my Samsung cellphone seemlessly including its cellular data. Once I found that out and found that it was like it had it's own cellular capabilities, I decided to keep it. I love that I can talk/text/ browse the web, along with anything else my phone can do plus more. It also syncs up perfectly with the wireless keyboard and mouse I got with my previous tablet. I purchased the 32gb tablet and put my 128gb micro SD card in it and now have plenty of storage for what I use it for. I would definitely buy another one especially since we all have Samsung cellphones in my household. My only gripe is it should be in the description that it's not cellular capable, especially since it shows up when you search for cellular+wifi capable tabs. It also has a great battery life! It lasts all day on a single charge. Great tablet for the price.",13381,1166,Laptops and Tablets,4.5,,33,0.0002

I chose this model because I wanted more memory. Everything you do wants an app these days and I was tired of limiting myself because I was reaching the top of optimal memory usage.  The addition of an SD card is great for data but doesn't really relieve the device memory required for apps.  The other reasons I chose the Samsung tablet are, battery life, separate headphone jack, and SD card slot.My only issue with the tablet is physical size.  I wish you could get the memory (128 GB) in a smaller tablet. This tablet is 6-3/8"" x  9-3/4"".

I asked if it was a weakness on all tablets, and was told that cheap tablets have cheap internals. So, I asked what the best tablets were for quality, and Samsung was the response. This is why I am now using my new Samsung tablet and the Teclast will be recycled. The Samsung cost roughly double the Teclast, but I'd rather have a repairable tablet than a ""throw-away"".

That's why I was excited to try out the SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab A8 10.5” Android Tablet, and let me tell you, it did not disappoint!Firstly, the 10.5-inch LCD screen is nothing short of stunning. The colors are vibrant, the images are crisp and clear, and the viewing angles are excellent. Whether you're streaming your favorite movies or playing games, the screen provides an immersive experience that will leave you feeling completely engaged.Under the hood, the tablet is powered by a Snapdragon 450 processor and 3GB of RAM, providing snappy performance that can handle anything from web browsing to multitasking with ease.

The tablet comes with Dolby Atmos surround sound technology, providing an immersive audio experience that will make you feel like you're in the middle of the action. The tablet also has a Kids Mode, which allows you to set up a safe and fun environment for your little ones to enjoy games and apps without accidentally accessing inappropriate content.Overall, I would highly recommend the SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab A8 10.5” Android Tablet to anyone looking for a high-performance device that offers exceptional entertainment features.

2023-02-05,True,4,"I am a low vision user and I have used devices that cost between 1000 and $1400 in the past. I’m sure you all know what those devices are and I found this for the price to be very helpful as a back up device to my more expensive device. It has some issues that you need to work around like the sign in screen where you need to be able to see the numbers to sign in, but that can be changed to facial acceptance. Overall, it’s relatively easy to work with if you’ve had an analog phone otherwise it takes a while. You cannot set this up if you can’t see so far I’ve had two people help me along the way with simple things to get over some speed bumps that are in there  But they probably spend 10 minutes for one person and a half hour for the other person so you can set it up pretty much as a visually impaired person because of the voice over speak feature. Again it’s not simple it’s not 100% wonderful but it’s doable and if you just take the time and work on it over a few days, rather than trying to get it all done in one day you’ll be better off and less aggravated. Amazon does provide an 800 number for assistance. I have not called it yet , but I will in the future if I need to. Overall, I am satisfied with the device for the price and it is a great secondary device to my primary device if that makes sense. Also, I have use Siri to write this, so sometimes it puts in strange words or things out of space  But I’m sure you can figure it out. Thanks for taking the time to read my review.

Also the storage loses 1/4 of the GB immediately when you open it.Finally it will not let you use a micro SD card and by that I mean you can put one in there but you will not be able to use it unless the app is able to use SD cards so instead of being to format it as a internal storage for apps and games and photos you have to hope the app you are using has that feature which the play store does not.,757,200,Laptops and Tablets,4.5,,0,0.0007

If all you care about is some decent performance, reasonable storage, competent battery life and a pretty sorted touchscreen, I highly recommend this product... but...If you care about the screen *at all*, DO NOT BUY THIS TABLET. It says ""TFT LCD"", which usually means TN (twisted nematic) screen. This isn't great, but the viewing angles and color ""accuracy"" isn't the full issue. The color setup also has no saturation, vibrancy, or ""depth"" and looks hideous and washed out. So far I have found no way to fix this in the settings.Perhaps if Samsung gets on here with a reply and a fix I'll change my rating but for now this is such a grave screw up I have to rate the overall product as slightly better than garbage tier.D- at best.",300,173,Laptops and Tablets,4.5,,2,0.0005

2022-12-04,True,4,"During COVID lockdown, I've discovered an app that permits those who enjoy singing to safely stay at home & sing with others across the globe. However, this app requires an actual 3.5mm jack on the tablet device in order to accommodate ear loopback feature so one can hear his/her own voices while singing, just like any recording artist while giving a concert.My old Samsung Tab A 2019 was working great but took one to many falls and the screen broke. The new tablets have all but removed the 3.5mm jack & replaced with a USB Type-C connector. Despite having a Type-C to-3.5mm jack, my singing voices had a delay & always come out about 1-2 seconds after the music had passed.In search of a replacement tablet with a 3.5mm jack (as the older pre-2019 models are hard to come by, only refurbished as they stopped making them!), I came across this Samsung Tab A8. Here's my reviews:PROS👍👍#1. Affordable: at about an $189 ( vs I found a refurbished Tab A 2019 model priced at $209!!) it's very affordably priced; especially for grandparents & small kids who don't really need the extra features#2. Quality: again, in comparison to other so-called Android generic tablets, often < $100, those are poorly built! You'd better off go with this brand name in Samsung &  backed by Amazon streaming devices#3. Ease of setup: simply power up & follow on-screen messages that will prompt & walk anyone - even those technically challenged, up and running very quicklyCONS🙄🙄 #1. TypcC-to-3.5mm: even those this adapter is provided, it had a delay of about 1-2 seconds.In summary , if your own needs require only YouTube watching, Streaming TV shows, etc and don't require any extra features, this Samsung Tab A8 is a good choice for Streaming purposes at very affordable price point. However, if like myself, you need the 3.5mm functionality for singing & recording needs, you may want to opt for something else.",2400,254,Laptops and Tablets,4.5,,84,0.0002

The system is not lightning fast but it is quick enough, and it streamed the first TV show I watched without buffering. The battery lasted 2 days of me playing with it the first time. It is lightweight and slim. I don't know if it's durable; since I drop things I put it in a rugged case to protect it. It came with Android 11, One UI Core 3.1, so I was able to install most my most important apps.Negative: NO FLASHLIGHT OR CAMERA FLASH.

The biggest problem with Samsung is they will only support the next year or two of Google's OS updates. Once they stop providing updates, the tablet is basically frozen in time. Apps will continue to get better and more complex, requiring new OS updates.But I still really like Samsung tablets. So I buy only when they are really cheap with the longest, promised by Samsung, years of OS updates. This makes them very disposable, which in turn makes Samsung a not very responsible manufacturer.I really hope that more people do like I do to force companies like Samsung to support their hardware for as long as the hardware can well run current applications.

Essentially anytime my tablet or wifi gets turned off or has to restart it disconnects from the Wi-Fi and then it won't reconnect without going through a whole bunch of steps. Finally I gave up and I am returning this item because it refuses to connect to my internet and I've never had this issue before. I spent an hour on the phone with Samsung and they told me to return it. I mean geez you think that they would have to figure this out at this point with how many years they've been putting tablets out.

It was initially manageable, but then a couple of months later the touch-screen suddenly became completely unresponsive with a lot of flickering. As it was still under warranty, I shipped it to Samsung for a replacement. They had it for a couple of weeks and sent it back unrepaired. Amazon then gave me a refund. I tried purchasing another Samsung A8 during thanksgiving. Added it to my cart... and as I was about to pay today I noticed that as a CYBER MONDAY DEAL the price has increased by $60.

I'll need to update this review down the line, but I wanted to get the basic review up for anyone looking like I was.Hubby plays one game. ONE. He plays an MMO game with RTS that is persistent, meaning it continues even when he isn't logged in. Lags are literally deadly to his account. I hate reviews that say ""I play games"" but don't tell you if the game is an MMO or freaking Wordle/Solitaire, so I'm making it clear.All that said, his eyesight isn't the greatest, and he needed a size-up from his phone. He decided this was what he wanted. He ADORES it!Great picture quality, fantastic battery life, no lag to speak of that isn't from the game server itself, gorgeous sound that will terrify your other half if you forget you had it turned up and randomly start playing something at 2am while laying next to them!It has an extra memory slot, but as he is only playing the one game for now, I haven't installed the card I bought for it, so I can't speak to that as yet.The only complaint I have is that his game field doesn't expand when turning the tablet to landscape. It stays the same size it would be on his phone. When playing the game on the PC, the field is enlarged. On this tablet, you don't get that. Whatever Google has set up for a mobile game is what you'll see. However, it'll still be larger and easier to see because the tablet is larger than your phone, so there is that!I hope this helps you decide!",13381,1166,Laptops and Tablets,4.5,,42,0.0006

This the best audio I have ever heard, stereo no less, coming from a tablet.Now to the downsides. Do not buy the 32gb model if you can at all avoid it. It is slow with very little storage for programs. I've read many complaints about Samsung not allowing you to store programs on a micro sd card.  This isn't strictly true as you can store certain programs on the micro sd card if the program itself allows it. Unfortunately, most programs don't allow it. Get all the base storage you can.To the more important feature...the wifi. I was perplexed as to why my download speeds on this unit were so slow...roughly a third of any of my other devices including much less expensive Amazon tablets. After extensive google research, I found an answer if a slightly inconvenient one. If you cycle the airline mode button (on then off) bammo, the speed jumps to a normal if not breathtaking level.

I've even tried setting up a hotspot and this tablet can't even detect that.Battery life is also truly awful.

I am using this tablet as a auto radio headunit. It works great for the most part. I am still waiting on a unlock method so I can root it but otherwise I am unsure if I would recommend this tablet as it feels outdated esp compared to the A7 tablet which is almost identical (LESS RAM). Also this tablet has an atrocious time connecting via bluetooth. I cannot connect my phone to my tablet and they are both Samsung supported products.

It's very slow...I mean even rotating the screen on its side takes 3 seconds until something happens. The battery drains super fast and takes forever to charge it.

I'm surprised Samsung released that product since users won't buy the better model after a nightmare experience with the basic model...Most important warning - the 32GB internal storage is already loaded with unerasable apps and software that takes 15GB already. The tablet keeps updating and that storage runout even if you don't touch the tablet. So that's a bit deceiving on their part to advertise that as 32GB for the user use...I bought a 256 GB SD card added to it.

2023-05-08,False,4,"MCHOSE's Adjustable Laptop Stand is a well-designed, flexible stand that tilts to different heights, rotates, and collapses flat, making it a versatile addition to my desk.I find that a raised laptop puts me at a better, more comfortable viewing angle and also allows me to vary its height which mitigates neck strain during long sessions. Similarly, being able to rotate the entire laptop also helps me change positions occasionally, making me feel less tethered to the screen.It is solid and well constructed from aluminum alloy and, in use, is almost invisible, essentially displaying a ""floating"" or ""hovering"" laptop.Unfortunately, I had to remove one star. Although they rate it for up to a 17 inch screen and list Dell XPS's among the supported models, my monster of an ancient Dell XPS 17 L701X was a little too much for it. No matter what angle I tried to position it in, the weight distribution was just too much for it and it slowly sank into the collapsed position.I don't blame them; it's hard not to run into an exception, and my behemoth of a laptop was clearly that.

Since it weighs less than most laptops I was concerned about stability but this stand is surprisingly sturdy and well-balanced so it definitely won't tip and there seems to be little possibility of the platform shifting unexpectedly and dropping your computer.  The 5"" long arms determine the height of the laptop base when adjusting their angle and the platform that the laptop rests on also adjusts to provide an optimum typing or viewing angle.  The arms are attached to a 7"" diameter circle plate that allows the computer to rotate without disturbing the base of the standThis stand feels very secure while typing on my laptop without any of the light vibration that sometimes makes me nervous about using these types of products.  The one thing about the MCHOSE Laptop Stand that I don't like?  Adjustments are held in place by pressure rather than screws that can be physically locked into position but that seems to be just about all you can find these days.  Pressure adjustments can wear out and loosen over time if they support a fair amount of weight or are used often to make adjustments.  Unless they are clearly very cheap it's usually difficult to tell how well the pressure adjustment points will hold up before they start to get loose but one possible advantage to this stand is that standard hex screws were used instead of smooth ones that can't be tightened by the user.The MCHOSE Laptop Stand folds flat easily--that combined with its light weight makes this a good choice if you're looking for something portable that you can bring when traveling.  This stand also works great with my Galaxy tablet when I'm using it to stream media.You can find cheaper laptop stands on Amazon but if you want much better-than-average quality I would recommend spending the extra money on this.",47,17,Laptops and Tablets,4.6,,1,0.0001

Being able to adjust the height of my laptop to match the height of my desktop monitors when working at my office desk has been a big convenience.My only complaint is that there is a slight wobble to the stand.  At first I though the bolts on the riser portion just needed to be tightenened, but I discovered that it was being caused by the swivel mechanism instead.  The riser components are all stable and secure, but there is a slight give to the base of the swivel that causes a slight rocking/wobble when typing on my laptop.  It isn't terrible, just a minor annoyance which doesn't have any dramatic impact on me being able to use my laptop on the riser.

While it turns easily it is not really meant for raising up and down frequently.  It is made to stay in in whatever height and tllt you set.

2023-06-24,False,4,"This is my first book by this author, but it certainly will not be the last.  Even though I read this book as a stand-alone, it is the latest in the Sunrise Cove series.  I didn’t have any problems reading it as a stand-alone, but I plan to one day back-track and read the rest of the series.Harper Shaw’s life imploded, and she decided that she needed a total life reset.  Putting all fears aside, she loaded her car with all her possessions and her dog and took off for Lake Tahoe, the last place that she was happy.  It was there in Sunrise Cove, that she would fulfill her life’s dream of opening her own bakery.As Harper skidded into the icy parking lot of her rental getting her car stuck under a tree, a gorgeous man named Bodie ran out to rescue her.  He feed Harper, then let her into the apartment/bakery.  It turned out that Bodie was both her landlord and next-door business neighbor.  She reminded herself that she wasn’t looking for romance.That same evening as Harper and her companion Hambone (her humorous dog) were settling into her rented space, a sixteen-year-old runaway named Ivy let herself into Harper’s place, searching for a warm place to sleep.  Even though Harper didn’t know Ivy’s story, she gave her a safe place to stay. As days passed, Harper saw more and more of herself in this young lady, and secretly vowed to help her on her journey.Harper’s bakery was sandwiched between Bodie’s tavern and the bookstore. Shay, the bookstore owner was initially gruff and impersonal as she was suffering from a broken heart.  Eventually, things improved, and she and Harper became fast friends.Each of these character’s had their own side-story and were trying to work through their internal conflicts as best as they could.  As they struggled to resolve their issues, often leaning on each other, they became friends, forming a unique pseudo-family.My only complaint about the book is that it was overly predictable.  I would have preferred more surprises, twists, and turns.  However, at about a quarter way through the book, Ivy dropped a big bombshell that changed the dynamic of the newly forming relationships drastically.  Who is this young girl and why did she travel alone half-way across the country to this place?The Sweetheart List made me laugh and made me cry, sometimes simultaneously.  It tugged at my heart and soul as I identified with each character’s plight. There were many layered stories that eventually came together as one.  The characters were well developed, each uniquely quirky and loveable.  In the end, they found joy, confidence, and unity in their little Hamlet.I enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys books about the strength of family, friendship, romance, and believing in oneself.I am grateful to Author Jill Shalvis, Avon and Harper Voyager Publishing, and NetGalley for allowing me the opportunity to review this Advanced Reader’s Copy.

2023-06-14,False,4,"Shalvis is a master at creating books that give readers all the ""feels"". This one is no exception. I'd sorta drifted away from her books for awhile but am glad I found my way home with the advent of the Sunrise Cove series. Harper Shaw is starting over. She's brittle, prickly, and talks to her dog, a 125 lb. Bermese  rescue. I liked her immediately. I did have to chuckle as she slides into town, literally, honest, and makes the comment about not realizing there would be snow on the ground that time of year. Uh, yeah, right. Anyone who follows Shalvis on social media surely knows what the weather is like in the Tahoe area.In any case, Harper is not just starting over, she's making an effort to change how she lives her life, too. For instance, no lists. I'm not sure that was a great idea when you're moving but, well, it does mean she'll be more open to random people and adventure, right? Well, not exactly. Let's just say ignoring an offer of help, twice, in fact, tells you right away that the new Harper is still a work in progress. Hambone, aka Ham, her dog, in contrast, seems to have never met a stranger. Of course, although she’s sworn off men, she's not immune,  noticing that stranger,  Brodie Campbell, is, well, attractive. He turns out to not just own the bar next to her soon-to-be business, but is her landlord. She's also not sure about Shay who comes to her rescue with kitty litter. The fact she's dressed up as Velma from the Scooby Doo crew when they first meet probably had something to do with Harper's reluctance to trust her immediately. That said, somehow you just know they're going to be great friends.I won't detail the plot as the blurb does an excellent job. I loved the characters immediately and the fact that we got to see things quickly through the eyes of both main characters, Harper and Brodie. The nuances and quirks of each emerge as we learn their backstories, not to mention the stories of the supporting characters. Now, true, you just want to shake some sense into some of them almost immediately, too, as they hide their real emotions and selves behind invisible walls. In other words, be prepared for a bit of an emotional roller coaster at times. Toss in a runaway teen girl searching for her real father and, whoa, life gets interesting for our new friends in Sunshine Cove. Oh, and you'll love the family texts sent by the brothers. They alone provide great insight into who each brother is and that despite the joking around they love each other. And, trust me, there are several love stories for you to enjoy. Just make sure that seat belt for the emotional roller coaster is firmly fastened.Bottom line, if you like romances and women's fiction that is both character driven and well-written, you should give this one a read. There's much more to the story than I've touched on, so it'll grab and hold your attention and, yes, give your ""feels"" a work-out.

2023-06-16,False,4,"3.5After her long-term boyfriend unceremoniously dumps her, Harper decides that it's time for a change. So, she heads to Sunrise Cove to open a bakery. It's the last place she remembers feeling truly happy as it was a regular vacation destination for Harper and her parents. Before her mother got sick and died and her father forgot she existed.Bodie, a former ATF agent, is back in Sunrise Cove after an op went terribly wrong and found Bodie in the hospital struggling to survive and his partner dead. Even though he's back home with his family, Bodie still holds himself apart.I always enjoy Jill Shalvis. I've particularly liked this Sunrise Cove series. Right from the start Harper is a character that is easy to like and to empathize with. She's had some terrible things happen to her in life, but she's still going strong. With the past year she's had, it would be extremely easy to kind of give up a little bit, wallow in self-pity. Harper keeps on moving. I liked her optimism in the face of having her world upended the way it was when her boyfriend called it quits.Bodie is kind of the complete opposite from Harper. He turns inward and closes himself off. I think that Harper and Bodie are perfect, not necessarily foils to one another, but they're like two sides of the same coin. They've both experienced tragedies and being thrown off their predicted trajectory in life, but they've dealt with it in completely different ways.Innerspersed with Bodie and Harper's story we also meet Ivy. A teenage runaway who has come to Sunrise Cove for reasons that aren't immediately apparent, but are revealed over the course of the story. Of course Ivy runs into and interacts with both Harper and Bodie and, again, she's a child who has had similar experiences to them both. Especially Harper in regards to having a parent who doesn't seem to see you.I like the heart-warming idea of found-families and that's exactly what The Sweetheart List is for me in a nutshell.Now, there were some things that didn't work so well for me. There was an added conflict tied into Ivy's story - being slightly vague so as not to spoil anything - where we see a contrast to her situation. Like we're supposed to see what could have happened to Ivy if she hadn't happened upon Bodie and Harper. I think it was too much. This element didn't need to be included to understand what a perilous situation Ivy was in before coming to Sunrise Cove.Also, the story is alternatively told from Ivy, Bodie, and Harper's points of view. The main secondary characters revolve around Bodie because it's in his hometown to which Harper and Ivy find themselves. A secondary story involving Bodie's brother almost at times overshadowed one or more of the main three and there were moments where I wish we had gotten that story thread despite the fact that it didn't really fit the overall theme as well as Harper, Bodie, and Ivy's individual stories coming together.I just oftentime felt like this story wasn't telling me, or revealing to me, anything new as it progressed that I hadn't already figured out. So it was a fine read, but I wish there was a bit more depth to everything.Overall, I felt like it was one of those comfort reads. Where the stakes are not super high so you can kind of comfortably cruise along and know that everything will turn out how it's supposed to. I'm not knocking the story by any means. I've really enjoyed this series, but right now, The Backup Plan remains my favorite so far. And this one in my eyes just can't compare.",240,91,Books YA,4.7,4.3,0,0.00035

All opinions provided are my own.Gosh if small town life doesn’t seem so charming in the pages of a Jill Shalvis book .In The Sweetheart List Harper Shaw chooses a small town—Sunrise Cove—that’s from her memories of her beloved mother & moves there to start over with her dog.Right away she meets mysterious, gruff hottie Bodie Campbell (I mean don’t you know he will be hot based on his name?). She impresses him (read: annoys him) with her refusal to let him help her.But they come back into contact soon after & then another mysterious person is thrown into the mix, a runaway teen named Ivy who has her own reasons for being in Sunrise Cove.Sweet & adorable & heartwarming are all words I would use to describe this one. My fave moments are when Harper & Bodie comfort each other—they start building emotional intimacy early-ish in the book & that’s something both leads really need, coming to each other with their respective painful pasts.Not only is there is romantic navigating to do in The Sweetheart List—Ivy becomes someone who is important to the development of Harper & Bodie’s relationship too, adding complexity in ways I both enjoyed & also didn’t wholeheartedly love (sometimes I just want my romances to be child-free . Don’t the leads have enough to worry about?  ).Though the book started dragging for me a bit in the end, the beginning is strong & reminded me of what drew me to Shalvis’s books in the first place.​4⭐️.

2023-06-13,False,4,"Jill Shalvis does such an amazing job at writing books that are heartwarming with just the right amount of humor. This is the second book of hers that I’ve read and I know I will continue reading anything she puts out.This book dealt with a lot of harder subjects like the death of a sibling and parent, feeling abandoned and neglected, as well as learning to overcome your past trauma. I think Shalvis did an amazing job with covering these topics. Trying to figure out your life after something happened to you isn’t always easy and you’re going to make mistakes along the way.Harper and Bodie are such a sweet couple. I loved that he wants to do anything he can to help her out and Harper doesn’t want to accept any of it because she is “a strong independent woman”. Their banter was pretty good, but what I loved most about them was just how accepting they were of each other. They both had things they didn’t want to talk about but they learned to open up to each other.I loved the relationship that Harper had with Ivy. She saw so much of herself in Ivy that she knew exactly what Ivy needed to feel safe and loved. Bodie’s relationship with Ivy was also so sweet and I loved how much he wanted to take care of her and show her just how important she is. Bodie’s family welcoming Harper and Ivy with open arms was just so sweet and it just made me so happy.I felt like in some spots the issues were solved rather quickly or how a character felt about something changed fast.

2023-06-19,True,2,"I've sadly concluded that it's a waste of money for me to pay for every new Shalvis book because they're all almost EXACTLY the same. Generic, flat, totally personality-free heroine who likes pets and junk food is all prickly towards our hero until suddenly she isn't. An even more generic, flat hero with LESS than no personality is just there to be allegedly hot looking, conveniently strong, and endlessly patient and supportive. I mean this sincerely rather than snarkily when I say that Shalvis creates FAR more interesting, endearing pets than she does human characters. The animals are always the best parts of her book, but there's no point in buying this just to read about them. After all, her pets are so similar too that she's now even recycling the same (kind of dumb) names!Another major problem with at least 95% of Shalvis's books is that the hero and heroine seem to connect more closely with all the side characters than they ever do with each other. With the hero and heroine, it's just light snark, silly miscommunication, a few kisses, an argument, and a weirdly unearned declaration of love once it's time for the book to end. In almost no Shalvis books do the hero and heroine ever talk on a remotely deep level, let alone seem to get to know each other well enough to ""love"" each other. Instead, the hero and heroine in all her books talk separately to friends, families and themselves in endless, repetitive inner monologues that can all be summed up as ""I don't want to trust other people or myself, but hey, maybe I should? No, I shouldn't. Wait, yes, even though nothing new has happened, I think I should!""The plotting and pacing were both a mess, as per usual, and I can't stand how over the past five or so years Shalvis constantly uses tired memes and overly cutesy phrases that we all see constantly on the internet while pretending that her characters came up with them on their own.So why two stars instead of one? Because there were a handful of mildly heartwarming or amusing moments. Even then, though, they're pretty much the SAME moments we've read in her other books. Honestly, I keep thinking her new books sound appealing, only to get the same flat-as-the-proverbial-pancake cardboard characters, sloppy plots, *extremely* uneven pacing, recycled cutesy memes stolen from the internet, and a weird lack of connection or even real conversation between the hero and heroine. The books always seem too long in the sense that they're repetitive, tedious and have VERY little actual plot, yet also manage to feel woefully underdeveloped. Hopefully next time I'll remember to just read an old Shalvis book rather than waste money on a new one, because they've all become essentially identical!",12,3,Books YA,4.7,4.3,4,0.0001

All thoughts and opinions are my own.Jill Shalvis has become a must-read author for me over the years because the stories she writes are reliably funny, emotional, and beautiful, while still being unique. Her newest, THE SWEETHEART LIST is no different.I loved so many things about this book, especially how different family dynamics are explored. There is the close-knit Campbell family, including love-interest Bodie, who has experienced so much loss, but continues to fight with and for each other, Harper whose loving family broke apart once tragedy struck, and Ivy, a runaway teenager searching for the biological father she’s never met, whose mother keeps dragging her into new families as she marries over and over again. Reading about how each of these main characters handles the challenges that come along with navigating so many different personalities was so relatable and interesting.And though Shalvis is known for her romances, THE SWEETHEART LIST isn’t simply boy meets girl when her car skids into a bush in an icy parking lot, boy falls for girl who often finds herself in embarrassing situations, and they live happily ever after while owning neighboring businesses. The book contains multiple side plots (Ivy’s journey to finding her father, Harper and Bodie dealing with their pasts and the demons that hitched a ride along the way, and new friends running from their own love stories) that seamlessly weave amongst one another to become a captivating story of love and family ultimately conquering all.Oh, and of course, a super-cute, goofy dog for extra comedic effect.",240,91,Books YA,4.7,4.3,0,0.0001

Both Bodie and Harper are adamant that they are not interested in romance but are unable to deny the chemistry between them. Adding another dimension to the storyline is the entry (literally breaking and entering) of Ivy, a runaway teen with her own agenda and attitude to match.While the novel addresses several emotionally weighty issues – death, post-trauma healing, teen runaways, parental neglect, love, and loss – the overall tone conveys hope, renewal, and unconditional love with a touch of humor.

2023-06-18,False,4,"Harper and her dog Ham are starting over in Lake Tahoe, fulfilling her late mother's dream of opening up a bakery. It may be a bigger change than she anticipated when she encounters mutant spiders, a family of raccoons, and a hungry bear in her first 24 hours, but she's determined to stick it out. With the help of a runaway teenager, and the bookstore next door, Harper is quickly finding her place in town. Bodie runs the bar next door, owns the entire block of buildings with his brothers, and after leaving the ATF, he's trying to figure out his next steps, which may include the cute baker next door.Jill Shalvis always writes a tight and concise romance with just enough spice to keep it interesting. Having read the first in this series (Sunrise Cove), I was slightly disappointed that those characters didn't make a cameo, but the Campbell family's relationships certainly made up for it. All of the characters had quite a bit of baggage to carry, which did cause them to seem a little one-dimensional and defined by those backstories. The story drug a little towards the end, with the requisite third-act break-up, but I always love an epilogue that ties everything together with a neat bow and gives a glimpse into the future.",240,91,Books YA,4.7,4.3,0,0.0016

Harper wants to open up a bakery in the town and has a place rented. She immediately meets Brodie Campbell, one of the brothers who owns the buildings attached to her bakery space.

Though this is a continuation of the Sunrise Cove series, all four of these books read as standalones. I have noted many times that I love reading any book by Jill Shalvis, as they are always wonderful pure romancesWe meet Harper Shaw, our heroine, who wants to start a new life, driving to Sunshine Cove (near Lake Tahoe), where she remembers how much she loved the town when she was a young girl. She plans to open her own bakery, Sugar Pine Bakery, which she is renting, in between a tavern and a book store. Harper is travelling to Sunrise Cove with her 125 lb Bermese dog, Hambone (Ham), and when she loses control of her car, a man shows up to help her; she is defensive, not trusting a stranger, and says she will take care of it herself; her dog is no help, falling all over the handsome stranger.  When Harper arrives, she needs to get the keys for her new place, which has an apartment above the bakery; and to her shock, she goes to the tavern and the man who tried to help her, is the owner of the tavern.Bodie Campbell, our hero, returned home to Sunrise Cove, 6 months ago, slowly recovering from wounds at his last job, ATF. Bodie, who runs the bar, gets a kick out of Harper, and finds himself attracted to her, especially her upbeat wonderful personality.

2023-06-13,False,5,"The Sweetheart List is Jill Shalvis’ latest steamy romantic comedy and the fourth in her Sunrise Cove series. Each book in the series can be read as a stand-alone because the characters don’t overlap. The Sweetheart List is a typical Shalvis story in that the heroine relocates to a new town to start over because her life is a hot mess.Baker Harper Shaw moves from San Diego to Lake Tahoe because her life is in shambles, and she needs a change of scenery. She had visited the area multiple summers before her mom died when she was 12, and her happiest memories are there. She leases an empty storefront to open her own bakery, Sugar Pine Bakery. Harper is also trying move past being dumped by her longtime boyfriend, Daniel, who strung her along for years. Harper is semi-estranged from her father and feels like men just keep leaving her.Harper first meets sexy, grumpy Bodie Campbell, a local tavern owner and her landlord’s brother, when she sideswipes a tree with her car. She gains his respect by refusing any help from him even though she’s in over her head. Bodie was critically injured while working as an undercover ATF agent and is still recovering both physically and emotionally. He is surrounded by nosy family members who love him.Harper encounters Ivy Roberts, a 16-year-old runaway from Chicago, when she breaks into the building to spend the night. Harper offers her a sleeping bag and encourages her to stay with her until Ivy gets her life figured out. Eventually Ivy admits that she is in Lake Tahoe to locate her biological father, who she has never met and has minimal information on. Ivy takes up with a pair of 17-year-old twins who are also runaways, James and Jessie, and has some adventures with them.Harper befriends Shay, a grumpy bookstore manager who is depressed because she has recently broken up with her longtime boyfriend, Mace Campbell, who is Bodie’s younger brother. Neither Shay nor Mace will talk about what went wrong in their relationship, but both mope around and aren’t interested in pursuing others.The Sweetheart List is a funny and bittersweet romance with engaging characters; the reader hopes that Bodie will recover further and let his nosy family in. There are two suspenseful sub-plots: (1) can Ivy locate her biological father?  and (2) will Shay and Mace get back together? The reader knows that Harper and Bodie will fall in love and her bakery will be successful. Jill Shalvis fans will eat this story up!

2023-07-12,False,5,"The Sweetheart List, the fourth book in the Sunrise Cove series is a great addition to this series. I love that this series is all about friendship, new beginnings and found family. In this story, Harper Shaw needs a fresh start. She packs up what she wants to keep, especially her fur baby, and gets rid of everything that doesn't bring her joy. She heads off to Sunrise Cove at Lake Tahoe, the last place she remembers being completely happy. She rents a storefront online, with plans to open a bakery. She arrives early and finds the store and the apartment that comes with it, are not ready, in fact the apartment is basically uninhabitable. With the helps of her handsome neighbour who runs the bar next door, she gets everything ready and livable. Of course, it helps that he is her landlord. When she meets teen runaway, Ivy, she feels for her and takes her in. Has she found her new life and family?I really enjoyed The Sweetheart List. It is a feel good, hopeful story that is a wonderful read for a summer day, sitting outside in your garden or by the pool. Harper has lived a tough life and was lucky to come out as put together as she was. Bodie Campbell was a grumpy, swoon worthy character with a heart of gold and baggage of his own. I loved reading about the growth of their friendship first, then a bit more. There were parts of the story that were a bit unbelievable, especially the parts involving Ivy, but I just went with it. This was an uplifting story, with wonderful characters who grew along the way, found family, romance and a trope that I love, grumpy vs sunny. Overall, this was a delightful story that I enjoyed by and in the pool. The audiobook was narrated by Andi Arndt, a narrator I have listened to many times, although often with a male partner. She did a good job with her voices, expression and tone. The pacing was a tad slow, but you would be able to speed the book up to your liking. I listened at 1.6 speed and it was perfect for me.

She is moving from San Diego to Lake Tahoe where she has  memories of camping at the lake with her mother, who has now passed. Her Dad is remarried with a new family, so she rarely hears from him. She has rented a small space where she plans to open a bakery, and has almost arrived at her destination, although is blinded by the unexpected snow in July.Her arrival is a week earlier than expected so the space is not quite ready. Harper is planning to live in the small apartment upstairs. Exhausted from the long drive, she picks up the key from the family who own the row of shops. She and Ham settle in with a sleeping bag when she hears a noise. Harper finds a teenage girl inside, hungry and looking for a place where she can get out of the snow. Ivy had come all the way from Chicago by herself, searching for the Dad she never knew. She does not even know his name, however, suspect he is from the area. Her mother, who has been married multiple times, is on an extended honeymoon and Ivy was to be staying with her stepsister. Harper takes her in, after insisting she contact her stepsister, so she knows where she is. They become close and Harper teaches her some baking techniques and pays her to help in the bakery.The actual story of Harper, Ivy and the Campbell family who are the owners of the row of  shops that now has a new bakery is heartwarming. It is a story of family and friends that come together and support each other. A long-held secret is discovered that shocks everyone. What ruined it for me was the constant cussing, and the use of the F word that did not add one positive thing to the story. If the language were cleaned up I think this heartfelt story would reach a larger audience.I received a complimentary copy of this book. All opinions are my own.",840,242,Books YA,4.7,4.3,0,0.0
2023-06-19,False,5,"I debated between 4 and 5 stars and rounded up to 5 because 4 was too low.I admit to being a Jill Shalvis fan, but I’ve “cheated” on her with a lot of other authors. I would religiously read any new book when it came out and spent too many hours reading all her back stories. Then I got caught up in the shiny new of other authors and her books fell into the “I need to read those” pile and never got around to it. When I received this ARC, I said no excuses and started reading.I forgot how effortlessly JS weaves a story and hooks you into her characters and storyline. The H, Bodie, is the typical dark, sexy, stoic hero who is back home licking his wounds and trying to figure out what is next after his last job blew up his life. His family welcomes him home with equal parts of love, nagging, and hovering. The scenes between the family and especially the three brothers are JS at her best.Harper’s got her own proverbial wounds she’s trying to recover from. This woman…. I want to be BFFs with her. What she’s gone through but the open heart and good will she has is what makes you want to hang out at her bakery every single day, all day. Cookies, pastries, need I say more?Bodie and Harper together just makes sense. The attraction, chemistry is there from the beginning. The quid pro quo they have going on made me root for both to get it together individually and as a couple. Bodie as a H has his faults but he’s more aware than he gives himself credit for. He’s Harper’s support but walks that line of knowing she wants to succeed stubbornly on her own. And Harper standing on her own two feet and realizing she deserves to succeed and be happy is what I want to read.The third character, Ivy, is critical to the story. No love triangle but a teenager much like Bodie and Harper trying to determine where she belongs and looking for family and love. The three together, Bodie, Harper, and Ivy, were the extra cherry on top of a sweet story.Steam level: implied, not too explicitHEA: heck yesCheating: noAngst: some but nothing that is endlessDark: no",840,242,Books YA,4.7,4.3,0,0.0

Then there was the visitor, late that evening, Ivy, a runaway, whoclaimed to have emancipated herself; but she was on a mission to find her sperm donor. Harper invited Ivy to stay with her and started teaching her how to bake. Harper and Ivy became close and trusting due to the similarity of their lives; despite their age difference. While Harper was getting to know Ivy and learn more about her situation, she also became acquainted with Bodie, the hot bartender; one of her three landlords. Despite having sworn off men, there was a definite attraction to him; that chemistry and magnetic attraction kept pulling them together. Bodie had never really thought that much about love, but he felt that same attraction. Bodie’s entire family was supportive, helpful, and had each other’s back; modeled by their mother how to be amazing and caring people.An attempt at healing a broken relationship between Shay and Mace ran through this story. These two had been dating since high school but Shay had trust issues thanks to the way her parents treated her and abandoned her with her grandma. Her grandma is a kick. She’s pushy and forceful, finding a way to get what she wants. Mace just wants to love Shay.This story hits so many touching areas. Shalvis takes on tender subjects with grace and care.

It was just what I needed after reading a very long, heavy, read.Harper’s taking a lesson from the Marie Kondo school of life. If something doesn’t bring her joy, she goes without. And I seemed to have missed the reason but making lists is a big NO for Harper. She wants to change her life and moves from San Diego to Lake Tahoe because she has fond memories of visiting the resort town when she was a child.Bodie is a former ATF agent whose last job went badly, leaving his partner dead and him injured. His family believes he’s on leave, when in reality he was fired. He’s got several brothers and a mother to which he’s very close, and throughout the story there are group text chats involving them that made me chuckle. The relationship with his family is definitely one of the shining points of the book.Then there’s Ivy, a 16-year-old runaway from Chicago who is looking for her “sperm donor.” Right away you know it’s either Bodie or one of his brothers, and you aren’t left guessing for long. How this complicates the family dynamic and the romantic relationships in the book is played out over the course of the story.There are also several minor characters that I wish would have their own book, like Shay and her ex-boyfriend Mace, one of Bodie’s brothers. She’s definitely comic relief, and I’d love to see the spotlight shine on her in a future volume of the Sunset Cove series.The romance between Bodie and Harper is a foregone conclusion, but it takes quite a few steps to get there.

The Sweetheart List was a sweet little story of three people trying to find their place in the world... and there's a dog, too.Harper Shaw packs up her belongings and moves to Sunrise Cove in Lake Tahoe for a new start.  Her last relationship didn't work out and her father doesn't even know she's around.  So she sets out for the last place she was happy and decides to start a bakery business. The first person she meets is Bodie Campbell, who happens to be one of her landlords and a local business owner.Bodie has some problems he's working through as well. A former ATF agent, he's working through some serious losses from his last mission and adjusting to a new life.  His family is there for him, and they are a rowdy bunch of siblings who keep Bodie from losing it.  The banter between among the siblings is just terrific and provides some nice humor.When Bodie Encounters a young runaway named Ivy at his bar, he is immediately worried about her.  What he doesn't know yet is that Ivy has a secret that involves Bodie and it's a doozy.The pace here was great for me, I was able to finish this story in a day.

This story had the humor I was hoping for both in the way it was written and how some people thought and spoke. It also had a boatload of emotions that weren't sappy but totally relatable. The non-romance, romance between Bodie and Harper kept things interesting and I liked her suspicion and down right hostility when it comes her early encounters with him. I liked that it started graduating to friendship and kept going.Savor.  Just Savor, is what I wanted to do.  I loved it that much.  Even though I knew I had a a bunch of other books clamoring that I promised to read by a certain date.  Help me, I've fallen into this book and I don't want out.Bodie, Harper and Ivy steal the show. Well, so does Ham in a more minor way. I liked that we get Bodie, Harper and Ivy's P.O.V.'s.  Adding in Bodie's wild, intrusive, loving but often hovering family out of his business is another thing that keeps him pretty busy too.  He says too busy to get to caring about people but boy, his actions show a very different man.Shay and her abuela are not shy people either and made me smile and shake my head more than once.Harper truly was a sweetheart with a big heart and no one in the story has ever encountered anyone like her before.  More than one person she helped wanted to know what the catch was when she did something good.  With her there never is a catch but they will learn.Ivy had quite the secret, which I liked how it was revealed.  It definitely upsets the apple cart for a while.

The two of them hit it off from the start and I loved seeing the trust between them build. Someone who has always had family to rely on, even when he tried to put up a wall between them? Bodie Campbell. The former ATF agent is recovering from internal and external wounds at the beginning of this book and he doesn’t want love or any complications. Then Harper knocks him off his feet and the not-as-tough-as-she-looks Ivy tugs on his heartstrings. What happens next is a whole series of complications, ones that could make all three of their lives better if they have the courage to open their hearts.It was easy to fall into The Sweetheart List. Shalvis’s classic humor is there, complete with a scene-stealing animal and a host of family and friends who are up in each other’s business. I really enjoyed Harper and Bodie’s romance; it was sweet with just a bit of a kick to keep things interesting. Their love story made me smile and I was rooting for them every step of the way. Their maternal/paternal relationships with Ivy were lovely to read about. Ivy’s secret, which could change everything, is woven through the story and is as important as the Harper/Bodie romance.The Sweetheart List is every bit as sweet as the name implies. It’s a lovely, fast-paced read to be swept away by whenever you’re in the mood for an escape. Between the endearing characters, the humor, and the heart, it’s a charming pick-me-up that’s perfect for any season.",840,242,Books YA,4.7,4.3,0,0.0076
2023-06-13,False,5,"The Sweetheart List is undoubtedly among my favorite reads by Jill Shalvis. There are many love stories in the pages of this book; family (new and old), lovers finding each other, and lovers forgiving each other, and finally, the love and passion for one's profession. Add in the characters themselves, beginning with our heroine, Harper Shaw.Harper is looking to start over in the area that was the last place she felt truly happy, Tahoe and Sunrise Cove. Having lost her mother, she's committed to sparking joy for herself and her future patrons at her up-and-coming new endeavor, the Sugar Pine Bakery. Harper is tenacious and quirky, always seeming to put her foot in her mouth, leading to many moments of good-natured flirting with local Bodie Campbell.  Their meet-cute moment leaves both of them intrigued. There is another star in this story, the homeless teen Ivy Waters. She's run away and is aiming to confront the father she's never known in Sunrise Cove, and boy, oh boy,  is she in for a surprise.The reasons I like Harper are many. She is very generous; she takes Ivy in, provides her with a home, teaches her to bake, and gives her a sense of belonging.  As Harper and Bodie get closer, we discover, we learn more about the secrets he carries and the generosity inherent in the entire Campbell clan.And then there is Ham, Harpers' Bernese Mountain rescue, a.k.a ""The perfect male, he was loyal, sweet, and always kind."" Harper would do anything for him.Shalvis again captures all the feels with the story of Harper, Ivy, and Bodie.  I am pleased to recommend this 5 Star read about family and friends supporting each other with love.Favorite passage:""Still, he’d originally had plans to maintain his emotional distance, but here he was orbiting Planet Harper, drawn in more each day by her gravitational pull. He was pretty sure he would burn up on entry, but it’d be worth it.""",840,242,Books YA,4.7,4.3,0,0.0003

Now that she's made her way to women's fiction - I feel that way times 10!!THE SWEETHEART LIST was a warm cookie topped with chocolate ice cream!The usual witty and fast dialogue Shalvis is a pro at trips off her character's tongues and hits you square in the chest -- and heart!Harper Shaw has left everything she's known- which is a lot - a whole lot - of miserableness, to come and settle in the last place she truly felt happy. That was at the age of 12 and right before her mom died of cancer. She's a baker by trade, an angst-driven woman by gender, and possesses a huge heart and an even bigger dog.Brodie Campbell is also a mess, although his kind of angst relates to an op that went south while he was an ATF agent, filling him with guilt and remorse. He's come home to heal and find purpose in his life again.When these two meet, things combust. Like, Shalvis-worthy combust.Two secondary stories that make this more women's fiction than true romance involve a runaway teen looking for her father, and one of Brodie's brothers and the woman he loves.All combined, this book was so full of the feels that I sighed multiple times from happiness while reading it.

2023-06-13,False,5,"You may want to clear your schedule before you start this one. Because you’re not going to want to put it down. Bodie and Harper might appear to be incompatible at first. After all, he’s a bit broody and grumpy, while she’s optimistic and sweet. He’s determined to keep the city girl out of his head, while she’s just as determined to find her future in the last place she was truly happy. Add in a possible runaway, siblings who relish tormenting each other, an ex who never should’ve ended up that way, and an abuela determined to show the new girl love in her in-your-face manner, and you have a whole host of people to keep you company. I didn’t even factor in the behemoth of a dog, who will gain a special place in your heart from the first page.Even though there are secrets to be kept, shared, and worked through, the love that is being taught and shared help to make it all work out. And even though Harper and Bodie seem meant to be, can they work in the long run? I worried a few times that misery could be the future for them, but I knew that this author wouldn’t steer me wrong. And I also had a few guesses about what could tie everyone together in the end. I’m glad to say that even with those guesses, and a few being correct, I was still surprised by how it all worked out and how much is learned about families in this story. Dysfunctional, loving, and distant. Each family taught a lesson and each family helped to bond everyone together.You don’t have to read the rest of the series to understand where we’re at with everyone in this book, so grab a comfy spot, your reading method of choice, and follow Bodie and Harper on their path to love and forever.",840,242,Books YA,4.7,4.3,0,0.0002
2023-06-14,False,5,"Lately, I have felt Jill Shalvis has been leaning more toward women’s fiction rather than contemporary romance. I love her books that are firmly in the romance category, such as her Heartbreaker Bay or Animal Magnetism series. This story felt much more like the Jill Shalvis I first fell in love with. Not quite the same level of humor, but enough humor infused to lighten the mood. And lots of warm fuzzies with a central love story.Bodie and his family are amazing. There was warmth and love amongst the Campbell family as well as the usual familial spats. For someone like Harper, who hasn’t felt she belong to a family since her mom died almost 20 years ago, it’s almost too hard to resist the pull of that warmth. Throw into the mix Ivy, a teenage runaway with whom Harper feels a connection, and this story is full of comfort and angst, kindness and uncertainty, tenderness and doubt. Bodie has a natural patience with Harper and Ivy that surprises even him, he wants to take care of them but also give them room for independence.The conflict is unsurprising, but it still broke my heart. Harper has just come to expect nothing of anyone around her because she has never gotten anything from those who should have been protecting and loving her growing up. She sees herself in Ivy, which causes her to not always make the right decisions regarding the teenager. Yet for the most part, Harper makes the best decisions. She was bound to let her heart lead over her head eventually.This story fully engaged me and has me hopeful we’ll be seeing more of the “classic” Jill Shalvis charm in future books.**I received an ARC of this book courtesy of NetGalley and the publisher.

Once again, she gave me a beautiful story of people trying to heal and find their place, and it was told with lots of humor and warmth.Harper was looking to start over after being set aside by both her almost fiancé and her father. She packed her things and made her way to the last place she was truly happy - Sunrise Cove. There, she hoped for a fresh start and a life filled with things that sparked joy.Bodie had suffered some devastating losses and had to heal both physically and mentally. He had been left for dead after an op went sideways, lost his partner, and around the same time, his father. He was lucky to have such an incredible family. They were so loving and supportive, watching out for him while also trying to help him move forward. They were a definite plus for me and added a lot of fun to this story.The universe also brought Ivy to Sunrise Cove, and she had quite an agenda. She DID find what she was looking for, but she also found so much more. This storyline was unexpected, but Shalvis did a great job with it.Shalvis' books never fail to leave me feeling warm and fuzzy.

While Ivy was sometimes annoyingly stubborn—as children tend to be—her presence added a slight mystery to the novel and increased the family atmosphere.The romance between Harper and Brodie was also quite lovely.

She removes everything that doesn’t spark joy—from her soul-sucking job to eating kale to making lists—and sets off for the last place she was happy, Lake Tahoe (who wouldn’t feel good there, right?) to fulfill her dream of opening her own bakery.  With her Sugar Pine Bakery in between a tavern, owned by sexy, grumpy Bodie Campbell, and a bookstore, run by her new BFF, she feels a peace she’s never experienced. Then she meets Ivy, a teenage runaway, who barrels into her heart. She sees a lot of herself in Ivy and takes her under her wing, but the teenager has secrets…  When those secrets explode, it changes Harper’s new world.I'll am becoming a .fan of romantic suspense novels when I can read one by authors such as Jill Shalvis.

Even with all of that, the characters grow, learn and love...and make some mistakes. Plus again...the humor is just great.This book follows Harper, who left home to open a bakery in the last place that sparked joy in her life (Sunrise Cove). While there she meets the Callahan brothers: Brodie, Zeke and Mace. They are hilarious and won't let her do things on her own, especially Bodie. Bodie has his own demons from losing his partner, being shot, and losing his dad all in a 6 month span. He has a hard shell and doesn't feel he has love to give anyone even though he loves hard. The two have instant chemistry but both definitely fight it. Enter Ivy, the runaway both care about, who has her own secrets she's keeping.

She removes everything that doesn’t spark joy—from her soul-sucking job to eating kale to making lists—and sets off for the last place she was happy, Lake Tahoe (who wouldn’t feel good there, right?) to fulfill her dream of opening her own bakery. With her Sugar Pine Bakery in between a tavern, owned by sexy, grumpy Bodie Campbell, and a bookstore, run by her new BFF, she feels a peace she’s never experienced since…well, forever.. Then she meets Ivy, a teenage runaway, who barrels into her heart. She sees a lot of herself in Ivy and takes her under her wing, but the teenager has secrets… When those secrets explode, it changes Harper’s new world, and she’ll learn, it’s never too late to start over, it’s never too late to figure out your life, and best of all, it’s never too late to let yourself believe in love.Loved Harper & Bodie's story!

The transforming aspect of this car was real selling point because it's something unique.  The first thing that I have to say is that in this day and age I can't believe that any manufacturer would make a remote car that requires standard batteries rather than being rechargeable.  I don't mind them in the remotes but in the vehicles is just a sign of being cheap. Things didn't really get any better as we began to test it out.  As we maneuvered the car we realized that the front wheels don't actually turn, instead they have a small center wheel that is used to sort of turn the car but not really in the way that you want.  Even this was tolerable but then I tried the transforming which is ok but doesn't work that well.  I decided to do a video and it actually shows one of the main issues with the transforming, the button on the remote doesn't control it that well.  As you can see in the video, the car doesn't want to transform all of the way, or it will transform and then go right back into car mode. It gets very frustrating, and I can about imagine how kids will tire of this fairly quickly if it doesn't work right.  The redeeming quality of this car and the reason that it doesn't get less stars is that it's a very inexpensive toy so you aren't out a lot if it proves to be something the kids don't like.",2,2,Toys,4.4,,0,0.0001

There are plenty of these types of sets on Amazon to choose from. Very glad I picked this one!It is actually pretty durable considering the material. We have had rips in seams and on the door but I think that's more because of the roughness my children play. The hooks that connect the pieces aren't the best but you can buy some velcro pieces and that fixes it wonderfully.My only complaints are that the poles are exposed inside the tent and extremely easy to pull out or move around. So now we do have a bent pole which makes it tilt a little to one side. The tiny ties that tie around mid way up are not very strong and can come off kind of easy. I've had to resort to duct taping the poles in place the best I can. And the button. It pops into a little ""pocket"" on the floor of the tent. But the opening for it to slide into became stretched out almost immediately so it does not stay. So my child takes it out all the time. I'm sure I could sew it in place if I took the time.

2021-03-08,True,1,"First of all, this is essentially a simple nylon tent which has dinosaurs printed on the outside.  The only reason you can see the dinosaurs on the inside is because the fabric is so sheer and cheap that the print on the outside grins through.  The only reason a customer would spend almost $50 for this simple tent is because it has a ROARR button which distinguishes it from the other dinosaur tents offered on Amazon for half the price.  The seller Winston & Olive projects themselves as a small family business that designs high quality children’s products based on their personal experience.  Don’t be fooled by this deceptive marketing as basically they sub-contract the manufacture of this tent to a factory somewhere in China and obviously have no quality control or supervision over the production and/or the working conditions in the factory.  The reason I say this is because I gave this item as a gift to my grandson on his 5th birthday.  He was very excited when he ripped open the present and immediately wanted me to assemble it so that he could sit in the tent and try out the ROARR function.  To make a long story short, the ROARR button was missing and my grandson was very upset and greatly disappointed.  I notified the seller and expected that they would rectify the problem by immediately rushing a replacement ROARR button to me so that I could insert it into my grandson’s tent.  This did not happen and instead the seller offered up confusing answers and excuses.  In the end I had no confidence in the sincerity of the seller to fix the problem so a refund became the only option.

2021-11-24,True,3,"Purchased for my son’s first birthday. His entire face lit up and he dove right in chasing his sister all through this thing. Both a 5 year old and 1 year old easily entertained themselves with this tent.The product itself comes in three separate pieces. A tent, tunnel and ball pit. The tunnel and ball pit took all of 10 seconds to set up. Just unfold and it pops itself into place. Folding them back up was equally easy. I can’t seem to fold them down enough to fit back into the carrying bag and I can’t remember if they originally came in the bag or not.. The tent on the other hand was a big pain in my cheeks (am I really the only one??). I was using all of my might to force these 4 tension rods into the top and bottom pockets inside the tent. Not as quick or convenient as the other pieces. I also do not like how the rods are exposed inside the tent. We already had some issues with them moving around and popping out of place as they are just secured with a tie.To secure the main pieces to one another there are sets of 3 toggle buttons on each side of the tunnel. You fasten the toggle button with a little loop that’s made out of the same material as the tent. The toggle buttons do nothing to secure the tunnel to the other pieces due to their super stretchy elastic, leaving you with gaping holes between the main components. Within the first 5 minutes of play (literally), my baby busted off one of the loops meant to anchor the tunnel as he kept sneaking through the gaps to exit. What I’m finding on the other side where the ball pit connects, there is again a gap due to the same issue with the elastic and thefore the balls end up all over your floor, rather than being contained. There is also a raised 2” lip on the entrance to the ball pit that my baby keeps getting caught up on as he tries to crawl through it.  For the short time that they were in the pit, I had about 250-300 balls that filled it (enough) for a 1 year old.I liked the idea of the square tunnel but it’s not its own stand alone piece like a circular one is. If this square tunnel isn’t secured to something then when a kid tries to crawl through it, it collapses to one side, folding in half.My first tunnel came brand new out of the box with holes in the mesh that quickly grew larger.  The seller replaced it when I submitted a return but I had to shove the who set in a box to ship it back which was a struggle. The replacement set also had its own issues with the trim coming undone around the door and floor exposing the wire inside.The sound is a fun feature you don’t usually get in these type of toys.Overall it’s fun, just not as functional as I had hoped for and the quality just isn’t there.

Since my 1 year old daughter enjoys watching Little Einstein, I thought a rocket ship would be perfect! This stood out above all the other many options available because of the yellow button that has a big variety of sounds and phrases. It's small, but tucked away in a mesh pocket on the base of the rocket that she hasn't discovered how to remove it from yet. It's perfect! The design is big enough for me to climb in and play with her, since the tunnel is a large rectangle instead of a round tunnel. We have story time in the rocket, cuddled with pillows and blankets. She has a blast playing all day even without me. She will drag it from room to room, haha! Our cat also thinks it's her new cat toy and plays with it equally as much. It's actually allowed them to play together, which is fun to watch as well! Assembly is so quick and easy. Putting it back in the bag takes a little more time. Out of the three parts, the ball pit is the one that takes longer for me to figure out how to fold again. The rocket and tunnel fold quickly. The instructions help with how to fold so I am making sure I don't lose that. It's not too ""masculine"" for a girl if you're worried about that kind of stuff.

A pop up tent is one which pops up and needs no further construction. It's a huge  disappointment as the tent cannot be easily taken up and down for play, and requires an adult to assemble and take it down. Sadly we didn't know this until we opened it on my son's birthday, which was too late. Now we are stuck with a tent that we have to manually put up and down each time he wants to play with it.

There's even room for their dog inside. They are squealing, laughing, and having a great time. Of all the presents they received the tents are the most popular.I don't want to post photos of my grandsons but in this photo they are both inside the rocket ship tent which is up on the couch.

It's a fun, colourful unit.The sound button is clear and has more sounds than I realized.Due to it sliding easily on the floor, placed it on a rug and solved that problem. Is ideal for a 2 year old, though stable, of course will ""tip"" a bit when the 9 month old younger brother crawls in and tries to stand up against the walls. Though both children were in fits of giggles playing peek a boo through the 2 mesh windows, is a fun space for them.Know it's not made for a baby, and any toddler and baby (along with their toys) need supervision so not an issue the tent will teeter a bit if a wall is leaned on.I'm extremely pleased with the purchase, its easy to set up and take down and like it has a carry case for storage.Gave a 4 for durability & sturdiness - although all seems well constructed we haven't had it nearly long enough to know how it will be long term.Haven't downloaded the activities that come with the tent but am impressed by that being available as well.",9962,1354,Toys,4.6,,1,0.0057

However, a very nice representative from this company reached out to me and asked if they could help. I explained the situation and without hesitation Jess said she would be more than happy to send a replacement.

It was fun for her while it lasted the 24hrs.Update: 7/9/21- after leaving my previous review the seller reached out. They sent me a replacement tent for my daughter at no cost to me. I up'd the review to 4 stars. I still see thin thread where the poles slide through and tie together, I fear it may snap again.

My only dislike is the sound button comes in the bottom/floor of the tent and my son like anyone else doesn't like to step on hard objects. However, they made it easy to remove, so we took his out and placed in on a table next to his tent and he can still access it anytime he likes. For younger toddlers might not be a good idea as it is small enough to put in the mouth. But overall it's an amazing tent that my son adores!

I found this tent and it arrived today- and within minutes she and her brother were blasting off!It took five minutes to assemble, if that- connect the poles, insert in the tent pockets, and pull the plastic strip from the back of the sound button. That's it and it's ready to use. The graphics are beautiful and we adore the Apollo mission recordings! Its very high quality and sturdy, and though I bought it on sale I would have gladly paid retail for the hours of fun my kiddos have gotten from it. It's going to be nightfall soon- and I can definitely see flashlights and jammies in this rocket's future. Its big enough that my four year old can comfortably stand, lay, and stretch out in it with her eight year old brother. I even crawled inside to assemble the poles!The only downside are the ribbons used to tie and secure the poles to the sides; I'd have preferred velcro pockets or something a little more secure. Sometimes on reentry things get a little wild and wobbly, and the kiddos accidentally shift the poles out of place causing the sides to collapse. But it's an easy thirty second fix to retie, so no big deal. If you're looking for a rocket ship, buy this now!",9962,1354,Toys,4.6,,8,0.0001

The only real issue is that the product description makes the ""vertical pleats"" look more like a design or embroidery, when in fact those holes actually are ""holes"" and may mean this shirt isn't a good fit if you have any issues with parts of your body along that line showing through. It's admittedly not super visible given the relatively small size of these holes, but still worth mentioning in my opinion.

This shirt, however, is all synthetic.

If you look at the product pics you can see how it tapers at the waist.- synthetic material used.-Sleeves are unusual for a Guayabera.  The sewing was nice.  There was an extra button.- the stripes in the design are peak-a-boo.- the bottom is not exactly cut flat.

I know he enjoys wearing them in the summer in memory of our late father, who as kids we always thought looked particularly handsome in the pure white elegant shirt from our lost homeland. The sky-blue color I selected looks great on him, and my sister assured me it's one of his favorite colors.

Maybe because its very Beach formal? Not sure. Over all it definitely gets the point across that it’s a ethnically inspired shirt with  a casual twist. However not executed very well.

Don’t give me wrong he doesn’t have to have it but he looks great in it! The three-quarter length sleeve is a bit awkward but works. I also got him the short sleeve version and it is better but for those cool nights  this one will work perfectly! The sizing is spot on and I will have to say the shirt is a bit see-through… Yes my husband is not happy that if you look hard enough you can see his nipples!

The arms felt like they were too tight around my biceps and forearms, and as much as I wish otherwise, I do NOT have particularly well-muscled arms. There is no discernible stretch in the fabric...not that I expected any, but that might have helped compensate for the too-small sizing.Also the material was scratchy, not particularly soft. And the collar tends not to gap at all, at the top, which means that the top corners of the collar near the top button feel like they're poking into the side of your throat on either side.So: A pretty big disappointment.

2023-05-07,True,4,"The Next Mug Heating Cup is a fantastic addition to any coffee lover's collection. This innovative cup not only keeps your coffee warm, but it also heats it up at the touch of a button.

Whether you're sipping slowly or taking big gulps, your coffee will stay hot and fresh. And if you happen to get distracted and forget about your coffee, the heating function will kick in to bring it back up to temperature.Another great feature of the Next Mug Heating Cup is its portability. You can take it with you on the go, whether you're commuting to work or heading out for a hike. The spill-proof lid means you don't have to worry about any accidents, and the cup fits perfectly in most car cup holders.Overall, I highly recommend the Next Mug Heating Cup to anyone who loves coffee and wants to keep it hot and fresh for longer.

2023-02-07,True,4,"I bought this because it was on sale, and it is normally priced cheaper than the Ember mug which I already have (and LOVE - I use the Ember mug every day) but it was wearing out - I use it pretty much all day, every day even though it has some flaws. The flaws that I hated about the Ember mug are not an issue on the Nextmug!! Basics - it has a travel lid!! That is one thing that the Ember mug didn't have - I was using a lid to another mug that almost fit, but not quite, just to get the mug from point A to point B... Also, my Ember mug had so many issues connecting to bluetooth on my phone - eventually it stopped connecting altogether and I was stuck with one temperature and it was just slightly too hot and would leave a film on top of my drink after like 30 minutes. This Nextmug controls are on the mug itself - no issues there!!! It is only getting a 4 star because you're still paying a ridiculous amount of money for a mug, and it doesn't quite fit in my car's cupholder which was a bummer, but definitely not a deal breaker. I've used my Ember mug for about 2 years so to me, having a self-heating mug is something I'm willing to splurge on, but having the controls on the cup itself is so much better in my opinion. I love it. Honestly, if it was slightly cheaper, this would get a 5-star, but I do love that it is cheaper than Ember and seems to be working just as well, if not better in some aspects. I also got the dusty rose color and I love it. It looks so nice!",96,41,Kitchenware,4.4,,33,0.0118
2023-01-10,True,4,"Got it as a Christmas gift.  Never thought I needed a mug that keeps your coffee warm.  It is a game changer.  Before Nextmug your coffee eventually going cold was a way of life.  No more going to the microwave to reheat it.  So easy to use and setup in seconds.  Original Christmas gift was a smart mug that did the same thing but came with an app.  App never worked, couldn't connect to the mug, etc.  App was outdated and only worked with phones that were like 3 years old.  Nextmug does it all without the need of an app.  My only 2 quirks/minor issues with the mug are:- It turns off automatically when it senses no coffee in the mug.  Great!  Now why don't you turn back on when you sense a new cup poured?- I wish the mug lasted longer off the charging coaster without the need of the lid.  Without the lid, it lasted like it says a little over an hour before dying.  With the lid, it ran the same amount of time and it was still at 3 bars.  I am just not a fan of using lids, but if this is what I need to do to get the prolonged battery life, I will.",96,41,Kitchenware,4.4,,14,0.0004
2022-11-19,True,4,"I looked at all the other cheaper versions of a coffee warmer and, as far as I could tell, they all lacked the main feature of this gadget: the mug is portable. That means as long as the battery is not dead (the base is charged by a plug to the wall), you can carry around a hot cup of coffee freestanding (the cheaper models make you keep the cup always on the base). That is why you want to pay up for this mug. After a week of using this mug I had to drop one star off my review, because the battery does die after about an hour. Then you have to put the mug back on its base, just like the cheaper models. I had hoped the battery life would be longer. It may not be technically possible, but it sure would have been better.

Therefore, there are a few improvements on my wish list for the Nextmug:MAKE IT BIGGER. BIGGER I SAY. 20 oz certainly wouldn't be excessive in my world.Make it microwavable to get the heating process started. The good news is I found I can fill the mug with cold ingredients and set it to ""piping"" and have it well heated in 30 minutes or so.Dishwasher safe, for the mug itself, would be great!",96,41,Kitchenware,4.4,,4,0.0005
2023-06-09,False,4,"My husband bought this for me as a gift. He makes my tea for me every morning and we had been putting it on a warming plate in a ceramic mug (no lid) and then it inevitably always goes cold after my day started as I would be getting our toddler and infant out of the door.Some Pro's for the Nextmug: The base stays cool so I don't worry about my toddler or infant or self getting burned as compared to the hot base of a ceramic mug that had been sitting on a warming plate.Some Con's: Similar to other reviews, the charge time just doesn't last the same. By having the lid on it DOES help keep tea hotter (science) but I prefer to drink my tea without the lid. For me, the warm setting is too hot! Which means I am always turning the mug on and off which helps increase battery life but also means my tea isn't at a consistent temperature. I also feel like the cost is high but, it is certainly cheaper and higher quality than other similar products.Overall, does it work pretty well? Yes. Could it be improved? Yes. Before buying and investing over $100 you should definitely think about what function you want for the mug. It works well for me (I may invest in a second docking station though) since I have the comfort of knowing my kids won't get burned from the underside of the mug, that I can still have a normal mug, similar to my ceramic ones (versus a vacuum sealed travel mug) and I love that I can easily transport to the car and turn the warming feature on there so I have hot tea for daycare drop off.",96,41,Kitchenware,4.4,,1,0.0001
2023-05-24,False,4,"I Like my coffee hot and this mug delivers, plain and simple. But let's get the bad news out of the way first. It holds 12 0z according to my Keurig. However, those 12 0zs are right to the brim, no room for my touch of cream. I would encourage Nextmug to make a 16 oz mug.  The mug curves back in at the top rather than straight up as a standard coffee cup. This is causing me to dribble a bit for some reason. The mug is worth getting used to. So, that's it for the bad news.All the other features of this mug are excellent. I've been through many a mug warmer over my years and most of them just don't seem the transfer the heat through the mug and into the coffee. My last warmer I would set for 190 degrees and could still easily drink the contents because the contents just never felt that fresh brewed hot. The low setting on the Nextmug does a better job of heating the coffee than this previous mug warmer. The medium setting and the high setting fill my heart with joy. Just be aware that the hotter you keep your mug, the faster you use up the battery. However, recharging this mug is so well designed it is simple as can be to perform the task. The mug simply rests on the charger plate. It doesn't have to lock into anything or be in some specific position. I use the low and medium settings most of the time and enjoy one cup of coffee a day. I need to charge my mug every three days. There is an array of lights on the mug to indicate the current level of the charge.Some things in life are worth enjoying and thereby worth the money. Spend yours on this mug.The things I don't know, at this time, is what is the lifetime of the battery. I see no mention of it in the description.

2022-12-10,False,4,"First off I am a notoriously slow coffee drinker who also dislikes lukewarm coffee. I used YETI products as my ""coffee mug"" of choice to keep coffee warm as long as possible. Then I heard about and purchased the Nextmug, and it has quickly become my goto mug. Let's start with the pros -1) It's a quality mug made with quality materials that has a really durable feel. I tested this out by dropping the mug from kitchen counter height multiple times and there were no sign of cracks or chips.2) There are 3 temperature settings on the mug and it does an excellent job of holding the coffee temp at each setting, provided you keep the lid on the cup. I was used to YETI cups so drinking through the lid was no big deal. Admittedly I geeked out a little bit and used a laser thermometer to test the coffee temp at each setting and sure enough, the cup performed as advertised.3) Changing coffee temperature is intuitive and easy and the LED indicators are easy to read.4) The footprint of the charging coaster is relatively small and fits the cup very well.5) I feel the cup is a great value for the functions and features it provides.The cons -1) My main complaint is the cup is too big for the coasters in my car. I would like to see a version that is geared toward portability.2) It takes a while for the cup to fully recharge once the battery is depleted. Quick charging capability would be a nice feature.All-in-all I am very satisfied with my Nextmug. I have had it for several weeks and it has become my primary coffee mug.

2023-02-12,True,5,"Wow this cup is AMAZING? I have been looking for a cup that can self heat for a long time. Sadly, I am in the hospital frequently because I have lupus. Last year I was in the hospital 95 days. 😭 I really enjoy having a cup of hot tea but when I am in the hospital, I can’t leave my room because I’m usually REALLY sick. After the cafeteria closes, I can’t get a cup of hot tea in the evening (when I want it the most). My only option has been for a nurse to microwave a styrofoam cup in a microwave which automatically makes me not even want the cup of hot water. I have been looking for a long time to find a travel mug that could be my “hospital mug”. I’ve tried several options all of which failed. I came across this cup and thought it looked interesting and the reviews were really good. My first thought was “a $100 coffe cup ??? What has this first world self indulgent country come to??? Holy fart blossom that’s alot of money!!” However, 95 days of my life in a hospital SUCKS! And during that time there is very little joy or peace. So I thought to myself “why are you spending all this time lonely and miserable and for $100 you could enjoy a cup of tea and it would bring you so much joy and comfort”. My favorite color is pink and I was so pleased that the cup came in a rose color, which is a lovely shade of rose/pink. The cup is amazing. It has a good grip. The round shape is comfortable to hold in your hands. The handle is the right grip and is comfortable to wrap your fingers around. The weight of the mug feels solid but not heavy. It has the right weight to feel like you are holding a comfort mug. It’s compact enough with the  charging base to easily stick in a small hospital travel bag. The texture of the cup is calming and the cup is easy to wash well in a hotel or hospital sink. If I could change anything about the mug it would be that it was just a smidge talker so that the charging cord could travel inside the mug with the lid on it. It just almost will close but not completely. That’s the only rhino I wish was different just because when I travel around I don’t want to lose one of the parts and it would maximum travel efficiency. That’s a small thing in comparison to the quality of this mug.Also, I was curious if I started with cold water (like I will have to do in a hospital), could the cup do more than just keep tea warm but rather could I start with a cup of cold water and get the water hot enough to steep the tea. The answer is YES indeed you can. I did an experiment at home with a cup of refrigerated water and turned the mug setting onto “piping”. I put a kitchen thermometer in the water to measure the temperature of the water when it started and then to see how long it took and how warm the water would get without the help of starting with hot water. It worked! It was a little bit slow (maybe 30 mins or so). But it did the job which is really amazing for such a small “device” of this sort. The water started at 43 degrees and it heated up to 140 degrees in around 35ish minutes. It did steep the tea perfectly! Wahoo.I loved my cup so much that I gave my first mug to a very special friend who works outdoors a lot farming in the north east where it is often very cold. She enjoys a cup of hot coffee to warm her frozen body while she is working. She is young and would have never bought herself an expensive coffee cup. However, she absolute loves the cup. Which means this is a very nice special gift to give someone who really loves warm drinks. Today I am ordering my replacement mug for my hospital bag.This is a very cool cup that works and I think it is absolutely worth spending $100 for the comfort and luxury this mug brings to life enjoyment.My story of my struggle with lupus is on YouTube if you search “Ballerina With Lupus”. It can give you some idea of what my hospital life is like and also my determination to fight to stay alive.God bless you if you have read to the end of this crazy long review.

2023-07-29,True,5,"Ok, I was prepared to knock a star off the rating for charging $99 for a coffee warmer, but . . . I have been in search of an effective coffee warmer for years. I have tried 2 different less expensive mug warmer plates which did a barely adequate (stopped working within a year) to miserably lukewarm effect. I like drinking a 12 oz mug of coffee while reading my tablet over an hour, and often had to microwave my coffee at least twice before finishing. With the Nextmug, my coffee (or tea) is kept to the temperature I truly enjoy my hot beverages to be until the very last sip. Since it contains a battery, I had to get used to the heavier weight of the mug. I prefer drinking without the sippy lid on, so if I set the temperature to “piping hot” instead of just “hot”, it maintains a satisfactory temperature. As the liquid gets lower in the mug, I can set the temperature to “warm” so that it doesn’t burn my tongue or my coffee. So yes, it’s expensive, but finally I found something that works. Hope it lasts me at least 2 years.",653,247,Kitchenware,4.4,,11,0.0001
2023-05-14,True,5,"This NextMug is a very well thought out mug.  I previously had an Ember Mug which I will compare to this mug.  The NextMug is well worth the cost.  In my opinion, the Ember is not worth its cost. The NextMug is larger, holding 12 ozs of coffee, and comes in different colors. The Ember holds about 10ozs and comes in more colors. NextMug doesn't require an app, which kept unpairing with the Ember, to set a desired temperature.  The on/off and temp controls are on the NextMug. There are LED indicators on the NextMug for battery life and to indicate heating to desired temp and when reached. There are no controls on the Ember. The Ember has different colored steady and flashing light indicators in which one must know their meaning.  The highest temp on the NextMug is five degrees hotter than that of the Ember. The NextMug continuously charges while docked while the Ember mug only charges when on the dock and empty.  So, with the Ember, as soon as one pours the coffee, the battery starts discharging and whether walking around or on the charger you have maybe around sixty minutes, depending on ambient temperature, and the coffee is cold.  Then the mug needs to be recharged while empty before using again. The Ember does not come with a lid.  With the NextMug and included lid, my coffee stays piping hot for over ninety minutes (that's as long as I tested it) while walking around and piping hot while docked.  One does not need to recharge the battery on the NextMug before using when placed on the charger.  I enjoy hot coffee or tea all day with the NextMug, without having to microwave in another cup. The NextMug has an auto safety shut off.  The NextMug is not fully immersible for washing while the Ember is, although I believe it is not recommended.  Neither are dishwasher safe.  That is not a deterrent for me as both mugs are easily hand washed but the NextMug appears to look cleaner after washing.  Neither cup is microwave safe which would have been nice for the Ember and not necessary with the NextMug. It makes sense why they are not. I am more than happy with the NextMug's performance and was many times aggravated with the Ember.  I have not had to call for support with the NextMug at this time so I cannot attest to whether or not they stand behind their product.  I did have to contact Ember support, which was easily done, due to one of the pins on the charger breaking.  Ember immediately sent me a new charger at no cost.  I can attest that Ember does stand behind their product.  If you are an avid coffee/tea drinker,  I highly recommend the NextMug. It's got a lot going for it.",653,247,Kitchenware,4.4,,73,0.0003

I noticed one day that my cup did not charge the night before I picked it up to examine and noticed the base had a missing prong that kept the cup from charging the night before.

So I purchased the base which was another 30.00 in price a new cup is 100.dollars I have been using it sense June when purchased and the cup no longer get that good hot cup of coffee like it did at first I have to stick a piece of paper towel in the top to help trap the heat in.

Has a long cord which is useful to me as it sits on an end table next to my recliner. Personally, I like not having to use an app! I’m impressed with the three temperature options. I use it mostly, sitting on the charger plate, it knows when it’s being used and if it senses non use, it turns itself off, whether on the charger plate or not.

The she complains that microwaving to reheat changes the flavor. This mug keeps the coffee nice and hot when set on ""piping"" for about 2 hours.As usual, she was a bit negative.

I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband, who loves hot coffee, and doesn’t care what kind of cup it’s in.  I don’t know if there was a dock in the package or not (Christmas is always chaotic at our house; if there was a dock, someone carried it out with the debris). Anyway, I have finally bitten the bullet and bought the separate $37 dock.  By now, I don’t care whether it works or not. The description on Amazon currently makes it clear that you will need to buy a dock, but when I ordered it last November, if a dock was mentioned, it wasn’t clear that it would have to be bought separately.  I am that person who when I give a gift requiring batteries, includes those in the box.  I don’t believe I would have neglected to order a dock, but it is possible.  My point is only that this mug isn’t worth the total price I paid.",55,25,Kitchenware,4.4,,5,0.0002
2023-03-06,True,3,"I use a pour over, and it goes into a glass carafe, and always had to microwave my coffee several times to keep it warm. I thought this would be the answer, but its too slow to heat up, and it has to use up all its battery to keep 2 cups warm. It does a decent job keeping things warm if its already at temp. but if you pour something in that is at a lesser temp it will take quite a while to heat up. So works good for my first cup, but for my 2nd cup, I was having to wait about 15-20 min for it to reach the ""hot"" (middle) setting.Perhaps my expectations are too high, but for $99 I was expecting more. I plan to just get a vacuum sealed carafe and vacuum sealed mug I suppose. Although I was hoping for a solution where I didn't need a lid.",55,25,Kitchenware,4.4,,1,0.0001

I tend to sit there longer since I am playing on my computer.  The other weird thing is that after I pour the coffee in it and turn it on and begin to drink it, it shuts off.  I then have to turn it on again and then it will stay on for close to 2 hours.  So it's a little quirky, but for the price, it's fine.

2023-03-21,True,3,Advertised as a 14 oz cup is a bit deceiving.  The cup will hold exactly 14 oz but that is full to the brim which of course makes the cup unusable as a “14” oz cup.  It is slightly more usable as a 12 oz coffee cup if the user does not use any creamer.  As far as temperature control goes the function does work but the temperatures are a bit low.  I wouldn’t call the “Piping” any hotter than I would expect the “Hot” setting to be.  So all in all I couldn’t rate this product higher than a 3.,55,25,Kitchenware,4.4,,3,0.0233

I bought this rather than a cup warmer because I didn't want to be stuck by the cup warmer. This one claims you can charge up the mug and then it'll work without the warming dock for ""hours."" I started with this fully charged and after using it for about an hour, the charge had already completely drained, leaving my coffee cold. After using it a few more times, I discovered that if I keep it on the lowest setting, it can make it a bit past an hour and I can get through both cups of coffee with it at a good temperature. Just be aware that you have to conserve the charge -- it does not last for hours, especially on the Hot and Piping settings.",55,25,Kitchenware,4.4,,15,0.0008

The first two mugs each failed after 3-4 months of normal use.  The brains on it simply freak out after that and it no longer stays on or charges.  I expect this one to fail as well, and only hope it's still within the one year warranty when it does. Would recommend if it was more reliable.  Customer service does ship a new one with a return label included for returning the defective one.  But it sucks that you're without a working mug until it arrives.Bottom line: if you think the convenience is worth the price for something that requires you to purchase another one after a year, then this is your mug.

The advantage it has over ember, is that you can set the temp on the mug.  Unlike the vistoo, you have to touch a button to do so.  With the vistoo one I would accidentally change the temp all the time, because anything near it would change the temp.I also love the battery level indicator on the mug.It just nails all aspects, takes ember and improves upon all of its features!

She drinks a cup of coffee on her way into work in the mornings and has tea some evening’s and she charges it once or twice a week at the most.

A couple other things I did not like were the weight of the mug and the finish. Kind of heavy. This was my first experience with this type of mug, so I'm not sure what's typical. I also did not like the feel of the matte finish. Totally a personal preference of course. The mug got great reviews. The few negative reviews were for the same charging reason as mine.

Once you take it off the charger, there battery is dead in 20 or so minutes.  The included lid does help stretch that to another few minutes by holding in a little more heat, but the lid is difficult to drink from.  It was clearly an afterthought rather than a well designed feature.  The mug itself seems well made and feels good in the hand, but overall it's just not proving to be a very useful product to me.

She said she couldn’t live without the NextMug and after her glowing review I decided to give it a try. I like to drink coffee slowly over a span of a couple of hours and so I found myself reheating it several times in the microwave. The NextMug keeps the coffee hot for as long as I want it to. It’s simple to use, costs less than some of its competitors, and does not need a smartphone app, since all of the controls are located in the lower section of the mug. The mug is crafted in coated stainless steel. If there is a single downside, it is that the mug is on the heavier side. It took me a couple of cups of coffee to get use to the weight, but now I no longer notice it.

2023-01-08,True,5,"This mug is definitely a splurge item, but I love it! The heat settings suit me perfectly, no app needed (one button push to use a different heat setting for coffee than tea), great temperature control for the whole mug (full to almost empty), and the battery still has one light left after two leisurely mugs of tea (at least 90 minutes on the ""hot"" setting, not sitting on the charging pad while in use). The bottom of the mug seems to be the hottest, but the sides (inside) are also warming. The outside of the mug is vaguely warm, but not enough to warm your hands. I don't use the lid.Battery tip: The only time it ran out of charge/battery was when I had a half-mug of tea left in the pot. I'd already used it for 2 mugs of tea (both freshly brewed and hot), but since I'd never run down the battery before and it was still on the 2nd bar, I thought I'd let it heat up the warm-ish tea left in the pot. By the time it was hot again, the battery was drained.I bought silicone spoons to use with it and haven't had any issues with the coating coming off (noted as a problem with Ember too, so don't use metal spoons).I also like that it allows the beverage to cool to your preferred temp. If your coffee is hotter than your setting, you'll notice the lights on the bottom sequentially flicker as it ticks down to the setting you chose, then maintains it. It was described in the instructions, but I evidently missed that part, but saw it explained in a YouTube video and think it's a great feature. Very well designed. (Still a big splurge, though!)Love my mug!!! No more tepid or microwaved coffee! If you drink your coffee in a few minutes as you rush out the door, this mug isn't for you.

Real coffee lovers usually abhor re-heating good coffee in a microwave and this keeps you from having to do so.  My only complaint is that you can't remove and replace the battery.

This means you'll have less time off the charging cradle - but the manufacturer's description of the products battery life is accurate.  The charging cradle works great and is a nice design. Now to nit-pick: I do wish the mug was larger, which would avoid trips to the carafe. I also wish the mug could fit into a car's cup holder and that the rubber gasket on the lid didn't leave a stain.

But, it keeps my tea at a perfect temperature on the ""hot"" setting.  The ""piping hot"" setting wasn't even necessary and it was almost too hot for me.I chose the Ivory Color for two reasons: (1) I liked the color best and (2) the lighter color would more easily show stains that would alert me as to how clean the cup was after use.  So far, after a month of use, the cup has shown NO STAINS.  (Stains are not only unsightly but they also harbor bacteria and can negatively affect the taste of coffee or tea).  So far, this cup has proven to be stain resistant and is very easy to clean.  However, I do wash it differently than my other cups.  My simple method is to fill a spray bottle with white distilled vinagar and 2 or 3 caps of liquid detergent.  To clean, I spray 2 or 3 squirts of cleaner inside of cup and wipe clean with sponge or cloth.  I then rinse cup and wipe clean.  After a month of use the cup still looks brand new.The instructions for set-up was easy to follow and the mug does everything that it was advertised to do.

It is better because the battery lasts longer. The lid is liquid-tight and almost doubles the battery life. A plus is that, with the lid, the Nextmug doubles as a travel mug without the extra expense.

I'm happy to stay in my chair with the charging base close by.I have been searching for decades for a way to keep my drinks HOT. After the McDonald's coffee spill lawsuit, no one was willing to make something that would accomplish this in a hot plate type mug warmer. I have been watching the Ember and now the NextMug offerings on Amazon for a while now, not willing to bite the bullet for the high price tag. After acquiring a side job that will bring in a little extra $ for a bit, I decided to treat myself. I'm SO glad I did. In my opinion, this mug is worth it! Highly recommend.

The mug hit the pavement hard, the lid came flying out, the silicone seal popped off and my coffee went everywhere. BUT THE MUG STILL WORKS!

It is definitely expensive but I use it daily so I consider it money well spent. I’m one of those people that find enjoyable tea generally has a very short window of drinkable temperature. This mug has extended that timeframe immensely.  My one gripe about the product is the lid. I purchased two of them and both lids have cracked from the air hole at the top all the way down to the sipping opening. I understand that it’s probably the heat that caused it but after spending quite a bit of money on this mug, I would have expected the lid to have lasted longer.

2020-06-10,True,3,"My mother has Alzheimer's and is sheltering in place during COVID-19. We have no access to her and it's heartbreaking. She loves listening to Nat King Cole and we know that it will relax her if we can be assured that she has access to this music and can independently identify the player, turn it on and turn it off by herself. This music player has the feature of looking  like an old fashioned radio, has very explicit directions to open to play music, and close to stop the music. That is the beauty of this product  - in addition to the fact that you can load your own songs. Now for the cons you should be prepared to deal with: 1) the quality of this product isn't great - it is plastic and while it's heavy enough, it feels and looks like a toy. Honestly the cost to produce this must be nominal so it feels like an opportunistic price given the quality. 2) The music that is pre-loaded is big band music that sounds tinny, super old and the songs seemed very similar so that's a no-go for a discerning listener - she may have dementia but in the moment she enjoys the memory of operas she attended and beautiful music. Loading our own music was a must. 3) If you choose to transfer your own music it must be in MP3 format. I read everything on the site and PDFs provided to figure out how to convert MP4 (ITunes) to MP3 format and none of these options worked. Finally, I bought Wondershare UniConverter (you can also try iSkysoft Video Converter) to convert these files. This took hours to figure out, so I suggest you go immediately to this method and bypass all of the ways you are provided with the product.  I finally asked our company's IT guy to help, and gratefully he has elderly grandparents and he was a good sport. It took him an hour to convert and transfer these files because...5) no matter how hard we tried we could not get this player to play the songs in the sequence we arranged them in on ITunes, or on the conversion list. This was really frustrating because I wanted her to hear her favorite Nat King Cole tunes, interspersed with Frank Sinatra, Johnny Mathis and Sarah Vaughn. At this point - they are all in there and regardless of the order - she will eventually hear them all. Finally, 6) if she is mid-way through the 100 songs I installed and wants to start over at the top of the list, the only way to do that is to close the lid, UNPLUG the machine at the back and then re-plug it in - then it automatically re-boots and starts at the top of the list - or she could press her finger on the button at the top back 50 or so songs to get there. This isn't something that cognitively she will be able to manage. Alas - this is a great solution for helping someone enjoy the beauty of music and for that moment believe she is in another time that has meaning for her - that makes it worth it. I hope this helps others maneuver through the loading process more easily than for me. As a note, the way you control the volume is by using a pencil (I used the key to a pass through lock - worked like a charm) and I taped that to the bottom with instructions so that if anyone needed to make adjustments it's all right there. Good luck with this product - I am grateful to have it for the reassurance that she is in her own world with the good company of music.",44,22,Electronics Misc,4.3,,62,0.0018

We loaded it with music that she likes, and that was an easy process. The reason why I’m disappointed is that the first time we put batteries in and turned on the music, there was a loud thumping sound through the speaker. We put in different batteries and that resolved. It also doesn’t make that noise when plugged into the wall (but what 4-year-old wants a radio she can’t carry around?) but the sound quality isn’t great overall. The bass is over-emphasized so that instrumental solos in our favorite Disney songs are barely recognizable. I think it will be easy for her to operate, which is great, and I like that the volume control is under the front plate so she won’t be able to adjust it without assistance.

The radio brings in a number of stations clearly, and they can be preset. The monaural sound is decent, and there's an 8GB USB flash drive with 75 songs (by sound-alikes, I believe, not the original artists) from the 40s-60s. The manufacturer also suggests putting audiobook MP3 files on this or other flash drives. There's just one problem with this: many audiobook files are 30 minutes or longer. If you're in the middle of a file, or near the end of it, and you have to stop or pause it, when you start it again, it will start at the beginning of the file, with no way to advance it to where you were before. So you have to hear the entire file over again. Not very good planning. For music, or shorter files, this isn't an issue, but it makes the use of audiobooks very problematic.

The flap feels pretty flimsy, and I'm worried a hard open or close will snap it off, but so far, so good.You can use headphones or the built-in speaker for playback, and the storage capacity is somewhat limited (4GB).

That's not the way it's supposed to work, and that's certainly not a good user experience for someone who wants to listen to music!Customer support said they'd never heard of this situation and sent out a replacement issue. Second unit had the same problem, although this time my husband used his PC to download the songs onto the USB and we had the same problem. When we tried again to download different songs, neither my Mac nor my husband's PC would recognize the USB any longer. We gave up after several hours of trying different things. This product had so much promise and I was so excited about it, but it was impossible for us to make it work as it was described. (And my husband and I both work in tech, we're very familiar with downloading files, checking their format, and then troubleshooting when something goes wrong.

She's technologically illiterate though so the iPod, while simple to me, ended up being more than she could deal with. I was driving to her nursing home daily, sometimes multiple times a day, to fix some minor issue or another. It was a giant headache. So i went in search of a better solution.This Simple Music Player is exactly what i needed. It basically acts like a hard drive or flash drive that holds mp3s, with a speaker attached. The volume control is a bit odd but workable, utilizing the product is simple, the sound from the speaker is clear, and my mom is happy with it. The only real drawback I've found is that when you stop and restart the player, it starts at the first song loaded, and works it's way through the list again in order. But that (IMO) minor detail is nothing compared to the immediate stress relief from not having to drive 20 minutes each way multiple times a day to fix an iPod.",472,195,Electronics Misc,4.3,,1,0.0001

I was under the impression the downloaded songs were all instrumental. This is not the case, and there are quite a few vocal songs in the mix. The instructions said with Alzheimer’s patients you really want to limit the quantity of songs to no more than 40, and it comes with 40. So simple to use. Volume control is hidden so not something she can adjust which is a GOOD thing as she is in a memory care unit. We have it set appropriately for her room.

The player did not play songs simultaneously from a USB stick you had to press the back or forward button to hear the next song. USB stick played fine on other devices. The speaker was distorted rattling, compartment doors were loose. I contacted the vendor who didn't bother to respond to my concerns. I thought the first one may have just been a dud or someone's defective return, so I ordered a 2nd player. The speaker was decent on this one however despite setting the volume when the player was switched between radio and music or turned off and on the volume automatically reset to the loudest setting so you had to reopen the front panel to readjust it. This just would not work in a long term care facility. When turned off and on the player resets to the first song versus where it left off. Same issue with the player not playing songs simultaneously despite no issues with it being played on other devices. It would have been nice for the vendor to respond to my concerns as they probably could have advised that their products are not Mac / Apple compatible! They should be listing this in their advertisements it would save people the hassles of trying to figure out why it doesn't work. We discovered this by trying a Windows PC versus Macbook to load a USB stick with our chosen music and the player finally played the music simultaneously but with the issues already mentioned.

2016-04-14,True,5,"I loved this machine. Very cute and stylish and easy to use. Appears to be very durable. My grandmother who has Alzheimer really enjoyed listening to her music. Music has a way of touching the soul and it could not be more obvious when playing her favorite music on this radio. Was fairly easy to program. Very easy to use, my grandmothers dementia is advanced enough that she was unable to work the machine herself except to turn it off. However, I have worked with elderly and dementia clients for years and this would work very well for early and moderate stages of the disease. Was a bit pricey but I have no regrets and would purchase again.",472,195,Electronics Misc,4.3,,6,0.0037
2020-02-25,False,4,"The single speaker on this has decent sound and can get loud enough for a bedroom or family room.  Radio presets are not difficult but if it's for elderly, it would require caregiver or someone else to do it.  It's very nice that it comes with an 8GB USB (USB-A) flash drive with pre-loaded songs.  But again, adding more songs necessitates a more tech savvy person.  Songs are played in order, so folders and playlists are irrelevant.  I like the idea of the panel to give it a clean look on the front, but if you need to adjust the volume, change from AM to FM, or search for stations, you have to pop it off.  Battery backup is always a big plus, and I also like that the plug-in (for USB and the AC cord) has a panel as well to cover it up.

2019-12-10,False,4,"UPDATE: She is no longer with me, but at least my grandmother loved my last gift to her. I am very glad I got this for her and that she had some time to enjoy it.Original review:I bought this via AZStore before I realized it was listed here. So you wont' see this in my history, but I assure you I've purchased this and set this up.This is what I've noticed so far.I don't know if my grandmother is officially diagnosed as having any form of dementia. She DOES have macular degeneration and absolutely no facility with technology. Whether the limit is psychological is moot since she can't see all that well and her hands are shaky.Despite her physical encumbrances, she also loves music. I'm not interested in sending her a heavy package of CDs. She gets confused as to which kind of disc/k does into which kind of player, confusing audio CDs with DVDs regularly. After trying a few ""simple"" things like portable DVD players that can play any kind of disc/k she owns, I was on the verge of giving up. But she still wants music and I still want her to have it.Finding an MP3 player that has large type and easy to use buttons is nigh unto impossible. A tablet would require fine motor control and good vision -- neither of which she has. So it took me some time to find this product.The simplicity of the device is as advertised. While I did consider it as alternative, I liked the description of the combination radio and player more than the Simple Music Player without the radio. For one thing, a standard USB drive works just fine in this model as I had hoped. You may be wondering how big a drive is compatible. From what I can tell, 32GB will work. This means, I can re-load a new selection by simply swapping the flash drive out without worrying too much about matching the kind of drive.There, however, are limitations. They are reasonable. You just need to know about them.Here's one: a 128GB drive will apparently NOT work. It is possible that it was the make and model of the USB flash drive I was testing. Still, objectively, this is probably not relevant anyway. I happened to have that 128GB drive pre-loaded and thought I'd test it. It didn't play. I really didn't expect it to. Switching back to a lower-capacity drive resolved the problem. Just so you know -- don't bother overspending on a flash drive for this thing. Bigger is not better and won't get you anywhere. But if you MUST -- then a 32GB drive will, indeed, be recognized by the device and can be played.But there are some more details to keep in mind. Considering that 8GB will give adequate space for somewhere around 30 entire operas in 256 kbps MP3 files, I should think that 8GB is enough for most purposes. And just about any standard 8GB USB flash drive will do. Just be sure it is in the usual FAT32 file system. Do not Mac format it. Do not use the new-fangled eXFat from Microsoft. If you are in doubt, either use only the drive supplied by the manufacturer and keep the format intact OR buy an entirely new flash drive. They're cheap these days, so that  shouldn't be too much trouble. Nearly all thumb drives come pre-formatted in Fat32.Also, the player seems to play files in exactly the order your computer think is ""alphabetical"". That's good for playing operas, because they tend to make more sense if they play according to the narrative of the libretto. But that means that you MUST be careful of what you name each file. If you can't be bothered figuring out what your computer thinks is ""in order"", then naming each file a number with leading zeroes will work: for instance, like this:001.mp3002.mp3003.mp3and so on to. . . .999.mp3That will guarantee what order things go in with no ambiguity. It will make figuring out what song is what much harder too. So you could also do something like this:000-william-tell-overture.mp3001-nessun-dorma.mpe002-la-vie-bohemme.mp3And those first 3 digits will be enough to predict the order it goes in.Just try to keep it simple. Many, many devices have huge problems with long file or directory names. This is not a limit of this device -- this is a limit that just about everything inherited from Microsoft in the mid 90s. Not everything is a Mac or Linux system. Short, simple, and in order is best. But this goes for just about anything on the market anyway.You might not notice because most media players have layers of playlist management or similar provisions to overcome this. This device does not have the screen, buttons, or related interface to allow for that. The filename is all the control you have. Reasonably, the filename is actually all the control you need.The product is advertised as supporting up to 1000 files. I have not extensively tested what happens if this limit is exceeded. from a brief test, it seems that it will likely still play what it can until it reaches a limit. I have considered trying it out more extensively, but that would be extremely tedious. So I do not know what will happen if you overload an over sized USB drive and plop it in and either hit the button 1000 times or wait for the roughly two days or more that it would take to go beyond a 1000 file limit. I would suggest that worrying about this limit is impractical. However, I can tell you that this device is not locked down or proprietary in any unreasonable way. It will work with various brands of USB drive of various sizes. Only excessively large drives present a compatibility problem. And those drives would contain far too many songs for a three-button device to control properly anyway.18 operas loaded with each ""song"" being one file translates to about 550 files. So, I could do about 30 operas or so and be under the 1000 file limit. My goal was to give my grandmother an ""Opera Box"". Given the fact that I have currently loaded about two days of continuous music on that device as it is, this should be adequate. What I am trying to say is that the limitations of this device are not so severe that they will inhibit someone with limited control of their body to use it.The next issue to discuss is sound quality. It is a monaural device with only one speaker in the front. It is surprisingly loud -- not ""deafening, rock-concert level loud"", but rather ""I can hear this from down the hall"" loud. The sound is well-balanced and surprisingly rich and lively. I admit that I was cynically expecting to be disappointed. Instead, this thing has me hopeful now.I really must stress this -- this thing sounds surprisingly GOOD.Now to minor niggles.There is some rattling of the plastic memory stick/AD adapter door if the volume is loud enough. The addition of a small piece of foam or the placement of a cleaning cloth into the compartment resolves this. Or, you know, you could keep the back off or just not play it so loudly. There is foam on the back of the lid, as one would expect. Some of the resonant booms of tympani in the orchestral recordings I tested were more than the foam could handle. I think some songs just rattle it a bit more than expected. No matter. Very easily fixed. With just a bit of cloth, the rattling is entirely gone.Now, for a few less-than-perfect bits. Yes, it seems that plugging in headphones will still leave you with a monaural signal. I'm not sure what the logic behind that was, but I also doubt that it could possibly matter much. My grandmother is used to monaural radios and can't hear as well as she used to. Stereo separation is beyond her at this point anyway. Still, I was initially surprised.Additionally, this strikes me as a calculated move on their part, not laziness or an oversight. It could be related to the fact that the amplifier is, per the description on the manufacturer's web site, a modern Class D circuit. This is actually a very good thing. This means it takes much less energy to make more volume. Batteries will last longer and it takes surprisingly little power as compared to standard kinds of amplifier circuits. This is a good thing. Making a completely mono signal was probably done to simplify the amplifier circuit even further. This would mean one Class D amplifier circuit for one speaker, not two total. So, this in turn means half the complexity and probably around twice as efficient. The result, if I'm right, would be fewer battery changes for those not plugging the thing in. Hard to fault that.I don't have empirical lab results to prove all that, but I can tell you that this small box pushes out a lot of sound for something its size. I am leaning strongly towards thinking that they knew what they were doing when they built this. Any engineering decision is a compromise. The designers probably made an intelligent one here. I just want to make sure everyone's expectations are set. This is not in any way a stereo device and there is no cheating it. And it probably won't make any difference to your elderly loved one anyway. But the better power economy might make quite a bit of difference. Perhaps I should test that and see. Or perhaps it would be easier to have it plugged in after all and just move on with my life. I dunno. Who cares if it works?The concern I do have is that there is quite a bit of hiss on the headphones when used. That could easily be an issue related to the place I'm living, as the wiring in my house is noisy. My guitar picks up quite a bit of hum in this house too -- that is, unless I use a battery powered amplifier. It could just be my house is what I'm getting at. For all I know, the long cable for my headphones were acting as an antenna. It would be hard to fix that if so. It is also possible that a cleaner signal may result from powering this by battery. I may do some more experimentation later to narrow this down.  But I should emphasize that the hiss is almost certainly unnoticeable by someone whose hearing is not perfect. Additionally, I must emphasize that there is absolutely NO NOTICEABLE HISS AT ALL from the BUILT-IN SPEAKER. If that is how this will be used, then it is entirely a moot point. And besides, it kind of tells me that it isn't the device itself and does have something to do with my headphone leads pulling in the interference.These niggles are minor and won't impact much anyway -- especially considering the ""target audience"". So, if you think this is going to get plugged into a less-than-perfect bit of wiring, I'd suggest batteries. Some electronics are more sensitive to that kind of interference than others for various reasons. It doesn't mean that there is a quality deficit. If that were the case, then my guitar and amp would be considered trash and they absolutely are not.Finally, there are the limitations of the interface. But in considering this, we have to consider the limitations of our loved ones. Sorry to be so direct, but there is a reason this device was ever made.The disadvantage to the way this device is controlled is that I can't give her a box that will let her, say, decide to just listen to Tosca and immediately set it that way. She will have to hit ""Next"" or ""Previous"" until she gets what she wants. This does seem to be tedious.But it is probably the best that can be done for her under any circumstances.She will be limited for motor, sensory, and cognitive reasons anyway. At least she will be able to use this at all. My previous attempts at giving her some control over her media have all failed. I think, however, that the three-button arrangement here will be within the limits of her body and mind. So, I know -- given that there really is not an easy way to get the thing to skip to a specific track without patiently counting button presses, this  might seem like a bit of a problem. But consider that in order to pick specific tasks, you yourself probably need to read small text on a tiny glowing screen and hold your hand steady enough to hit a tiny object. My grandmother can't do that. If yours can, maybe she doesn't need this product yet. I've tried everything else. I'm pretty sure this is our best option. We'll see what happens when she opens her gift and tries it.I may amend this later to report on how she likes her Christmas gift. But I for one think that this is worth it and nicely done.",89,33,Electronics Misc,4.3,,39,0.0001
2021-12-14,True,4,"My mother-in-law has never been good with technology and now with advanced dementia, even something this easy is a bit of a struggle for her.  There are literally 3 buttons and a slide switch on this device but she still has trouble. To be fair with this review, I'm going to break it into 3 parts: How I see it, how my mother-in-law sees it and how a typical older person might see it.How I See It - From years of providing IT support to my mother-in-law (MIL), I know that she will push every button twice to try and get it to do what she wants. I was leaning towards the SMPL music player that doesn't have the radio but my wife wanted to get this one. Fewer buttons would have been better and she likes the music and not the radio with commercials and ""noise"".  On the other hand, not having an accessible volume is weird and both my MIL and my wife often comment on it being too loud or too quiet. The ability to skip forward or backwards is simple but my MIL doesn't use this as she can't clearly read the labels on the buttons. I am almost to the point of getting out my Sharpie marker and writing above the buttons to make it more clear.  Adding songs was easy and I added 40 to get to a total of 115 songs. I simply plugged the USB stick into my PC and copied over MP3 files that I purchased on Amazon. Finally, I was a bit surprised at how big this radio is. Does it need to be this big? I suppose it will keep it from becoming misplaced or thrown out, but it is big.How My Mother-In-Law Sees it - When it is playing music, she smiles, dances and sings along. Then a song comes on she doesn't know and she stops. She seems distracted and wants something different to happen. Usually she wants to turn it down, but since she can't, I remind her that she can just skip ahead. She seems pleasantly surprised and asks how to do that. I show her and she seems confused by it. Sometimes she wants to turn it off but is also unsure of how to do so. I don't know how much easier it could be than to push the big silver button on top and I expect that when I'm not there she will accomplish this.How a Typical Older Person Might See This - It really is simple to operate and seems difficult to screw things up. I think someone with early onset of dementia would easily figure out how to operate it but might be frustrated that the volume is missing. They will certainly want more than 75 songs and perhaps a different style/genre of songs that what it comes with, but that is pretty easy to accomplish. I also think that the hidden compartments are not that hidden and although my MIL hasn't found them (yet), someone looking for a volume or some other function might easily pop off a door/lid and cause some trouble!Finally, as of December 2021, I can't find anything better on the market and I think that overall this is pretty well done. I do hope other products for those with dementia will come along!",89,33,Electronics Misc,4.3,,1,0.0

2022-08-11,True,2,"The refrigerator does NOT come with the latching lid as shown in the images. There is no latch on the door and it was one of the main reasons I purchased this one instead of the many others like it. This makes opening the door a two handed operation as you will have to brace the refrigerator with your other hand, otherwise you'd lift the whole unit when opening.Contacting the manufacturer or Amazon is no use as they will try to bounce you back and forth and never return your calls.  Good luck getting any kind of warranty support afterwards.The extended warranty offered by Assurant is a joke as well. They will claim they never received the information from Amazon and Amazon will bounce you back to the company.  In the end, you'll get a refund, but no protection.The fridge itself is a bit louder than I'd hope and definitely noticeable and cycles frequently. I would not want it running inside if I'm nearby or sleeping next to it. In the back of a SUV or trunk is OK.The partitions inside for the dual zone also take up a lot of the interior space. Most of the time I end up using it without it because of that.The temperature is about 4-5 degrees warmer than shown, plus another 5 degrees when it's cycling. I normally set it about 10 degrees cooler than the temperature I need. The temperature also varies a lot depending on where the food is.Bluetooth connection is a nice feature and connects most times.

2023-01-18,True,4,"I purchased this portable refrigerator for a van conversion. I think it represents a good value for light use. Comparison refrigerators of higher quality are over $1000.My first observations for performance were good. From 70° to 34° in about 15 minutes on the refrigerator side-- phenomenal really. And then the freezer portion took about 35 to 40 minutes to get down to zero.The longer this runs, the less the differential there is between set temperature and actual temperature. At first the fluctuations were fairly large – in the 8 to 10° range.Initial usage showed pretty close to 80 watts of power being used. Once this is up to temperature and has been running for a while my average usage has been around 35 Watts. In eco-mode it can drop down to 24 to 25 watts on 12 volt.The biggest thing I notice on eco-mode is the temperature difference is greater. 35 Watts on ""Max"" mode is not bad though.The unit certainly runs a lot more than my standard household refrigerator, and I hear the fan more than I hear the compressor. There are some minor vibrations, but nothing major.I actually think once this is loaded up with food it will probably cycle less, as the contents will give back some cold. I also think it would benefit greatly with some extra insulation. I'm going to do a pull out drawer in my van, and will add 1 to 1-1/2 inches of some rigid foam insulation, which should help the cycling. I think this is running probably half the time, as opposed to one third of the time. That's what I recall from my higher end fridges from previous vans. Bottom line is it's just not as efficient at holding the cold.The app works very well, and was very easy to connect. About the only thing I'd like to see is cumulative energy usage for the day, but I have some other meters that can determine that.I did buy the five-year assurance plan, just in case this unit decides to fizzle out within a few years. My understanding is they last about two years of heavier use before the compressor goes. The manufacturer offers these with an LG compressor, but I don't think you can buy them configured this way under the Vevor name. This is essentially a rebranded Apicooler. Apicooler I think sells these without the basket, so I think this represents pretty good value here on Amazon as they include the baskets.I also like the fact you can run this on 12 or 24 V or on 120 or 240. Unfortunately there's not dual inputs, so you would have to disconnect to run on 120, but at least it's possible.I have no idea of the evenness of the temperatures, but will check in more detail. There's no internal fans, so I suspect there are cold and hot spots.The hardware is all plastic, as are the wheels, and it's just a friction fit lid. They've got a cut corners somewhere to keep the price down. I don't much care for the friction fit lid, as it's hard to open.I bought the 62 quart model and although it has wheels I would hardly call this thing  ""portable"". There's just not much ground clearance, and loaded up with food it would probably be 50+ pounds. For my van conversion it works well.Overall I think these represent a good value as there is a huge cost savings over a high-end unit like dometic, Engel, ABR, etc.",17,8,Kitchenware,4.3,,10,0.0001
2022-10-19,True,4,I have only had this cooler for a week.  I will update again in a few months.  So far I am pleased with it.  Had it running nonstop for a week and no issues.  I had both sides a -4F and they froze room temp food rock hard.  It did take almost to days to do that.  I had temp probes in both sides and it was within two degrees of what the display was showing.  I now have the large side at 35 and the smaller side at -4 and it is holding.  My only complaint so far is the app has a hard time reconnecting.  I have to close the app fully then it will reconnect on open.,17,8,Kitchenware,4.3,,4,0.0005
2022-08-01,True,4,"I used this unit with 100W solar panel, charge controller and 12 volt battery to run 24x7 in 90 degree temps.of course the unit drew from the battery at night, but the solar capacity allowed for full recharge before next evening.  I think this is a persistent solution for people wanting to do similar.Maximum observed power consumption was 3amps.  Hopefully this will let you pick the correct battery or power station.  Duty cycle will depend on temp differential, especially since the unit is not as insulated as you'd like.  Condensation will form on the outside of the unit due to thermal transfer.",17,8,Kitchenware,4.3,,11,0.0903
2023-05-25,True,5,"Used this for an overlanding trip over the weekend utilizing the ac plug in a day before we left to get the cooler to the Temps we wanted before the trip.  Then swapped over to the DC cable during the 3 days of use while on the trip.  Cooler worked perfectly. The refrigerator side floated between 42 and 48 degrees (Was set to 40 degrees) and the freezer side floated between 15 and 20 degrees ( was set to 10 degrees) I was using a thermal surface gun for the readings.  I was using the top of each side of the fridge for my readings (warmest points).  Fridge is quiet, and doesn't produce a significant amount of heat from the cooling system.  Overall pretty impressed with the 63qt model.",116,31,Kitchenware,4.3,,1,0.002
2022-11-10,True,5,"I truly have to say this is probably one of the best purchases I have ever made. Less than a week before I was supposed to go camping for 10 days the little fridge in my camper died. So I decided to get one of these. It came pretty well packaged, it could have used a bit more in my opinion, but it was undamaged. I was skeptical that it reach the subzero Temps that it claimed but I tested it and it did. It worked amazingly throughout the whole trip. Even off batteries and solar it never drained my setup. It was very quiet, the leaves falling outside were louder than it. Probably the best part was that at the end of the trip, I simply unplugged it, pulled it out of the camper and put it into my suv and plugged it back in, then cause I was getting home late, I simply put it in the house and pulled it back in using the 110v adapter and all the food stayed perfect till the next day when I put the food away. I highly recommend this. The only thing  that could make this any better would be latches and a gasket sealing the lid better.TL:DRHighly functional fridge freezer comboVery portableVery quietWorked perfectly",116,31,Kitchenware,4.3,,4,0.0001
2022-06-18,True,5,"After purchasing 3 prior 12v fridges, this is the first one that works in our vehicle’s AC outlet. We’re currently taking it on a 2 week cross-country trip to keep food and liquids cold and frozen food cold. It’s been working great so far so we can keep our daughter’s gluten-free food for when we have no celiac friendly options in places we stay. I really love the removable divider for when we just need a big fridge as well as the Bluetooth app on my phone to check on the temperature as well as adjust it while it’s in the back of the vehicle. The wheels are also a godsend when transporting from vehicle to hotel room. I would buy this fridge again in a heartbeat.",116,31,Kitchenware,4.3,,6,0.0048
2022-07-25,True,5,"After returning my first refrigerator of another brand because it didn't work properly, I settled on this one.  It cools and shuts off when it reaches the desired temperature.  Something my first one didn't do.  The only reservation I have is the one that I received is not what is pictured on Amazon.  The lid is a friction type.  What is pictured shows a handle that you pull to release the lid.  I have no latching mechanism, just yank it open.  I think I would have rather have the latching type but I'm not going to return this one too.  I'll live with it.",116,31,Kitchenware,4.3,,4,0.0015
